# oci_apigateway_gateway
This resource provides the Gateway resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway service.

Creates a new gateway.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_apigateway_gateway" "test_gateway" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	endpoint_type = var.gateway_endpoint_type
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = var.gateway_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment in which the resource is created. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My new resource` 
* `endpoint_type` - (Required) Gateway endpoint type. `PUBLIC` will have a public ip address assigned to it, while `PRIVATE` will only be accessible on a private IP address on the subnet.  Example: `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE` 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet in which related resources are created. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
