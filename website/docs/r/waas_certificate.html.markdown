# oci_waas_certificate
This resource provides the Certificate resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Waas service.

Allows an SSL certificate to be added to a WAAS policy. The Web Application Firewall terminates SSL connections to inspect requests in runtime, and then re-encrypts requests before sending them to the origin for fulfillment.

For more information, see [WAF Settings](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/WAF/Tasks/wafsettings.htm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_waas_certificate" "test_certificate" {
	#Required
	certificate_data = "${var.certificate_certificate_data}"
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	private_key_data = "${var.certificate_private_key_data}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.certificate_display_name}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_trust_verification_disabled = "${var.certificate_is_trust_verification_disabled}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `certificate_data` - (Required) The data of the SSL certificate.

	 **Note:** Many SSL certificate providers require an intermediate certificate chain to ensure a trusted status. If your SSL certificate requires an intermediate certificate chain, please append the intermediate certificate key in the `certificateData` field after the leaf certificate issued by the SSL certificate provider. If you are unsure if your certificate requires an intermediate certificate chain, see your certificate provider's documentation.

	 The example below shows an intermediate certificate appended to a leaf certificate. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment in which to create the SSL certificate.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name for the SSL certificate. The name can be changed and does not need to be unique.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_trust_verification_disabled` - (Optional) Set to `true` if the SSL certificate is self-signed.
* `private_key_data` - (Required) The private key of the SSL certificate.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the SSL certificate's compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name of the SSL certificate.
