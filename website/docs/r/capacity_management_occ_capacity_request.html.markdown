# oci_capacity_management_occ_capacity_request
This resource provides the Occ Capacity Request resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Capacity Management service.

Create Capacity Request.
  Updates the OccCapacityRequest by evaluating a sequence of instructions.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Occ Capacity Request
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Occ Capacity Request
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Occ Capacity Request


## Import

OccCapacityRequests can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_capacity_management_occ_capacity_request.test_occ_capacity_request "id"
```
