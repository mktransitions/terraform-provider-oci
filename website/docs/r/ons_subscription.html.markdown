# oci_ons_subscription
This resource provides the Subscription resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notifications service.

Creates a subscription for the specified topic and sends a subscription confirmation URL to the endpoint. The subscription remains in "Pending" status until it has been confirmed.
For information about confirming subscriptions, see
[To confirm a subscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/managingtopicsandsubscriptions.htm#confirmSub).

Transactions Per Minute (TPM) per-tenancy limit for this operation: 60.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_ons_subscription" "test_subscription" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	endpoint = var.subscription_endpoint
	protocol = var.subscription_protocol
	topic_id = oci_ons_notification_topic.test_notification_topic.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment for the subscription. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `endpoint` - (Required) A locator that corresponds to the subscription protocol. For example, an email address for a subscription that uses the `EMAIL` protocol, or a URL for a subscription that uses an HTTP-based protocol. HTTP-based protocols use URL endpoints that begin with "http:" or "https:". A URL cannot exceed 512 characters. Avoid entering confidential information.
