## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `admin_password` - (Required) The password for the administrative user. The password must be between 8 and 32 characters long, and must contain at least 1 numeric character, 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, and 1 special (nonalphanumeric) character. 
* `admin_username` - (Required) The username for the administrative user.
* `availability_domain` - (Required) The Availability Domain where the primary instance should be located. 
* `backup_policy` - (Optional) (Updatable) 
	* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces.

		Tags defined here will be copied verbatim as tags on the Backup resource created by this BackupPolicy.

		Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `is_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies if automatic backups are enabled. 
	* `retention_in_days` - (Optional) (Updatable) Number of days to retain an automatic backup.
	* `window_start_time` - (Optional) (Updatable) The start of a 30-minute window of time in which daily, automated backups occur.

		This should be in the format of the "Time" portion of an RFC3339-formatted timestamp. Any second or sub-second time data will be truncated to zero.

		At some point in the window, the system may incur a brief service disruption as the backup is performed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `configuration_id` - (Required) The OCID of the Configuration to be used for this DB System.
* `data_storage_size_in_gb` - (Optional) Initial size of the data volume in GBs that will be created and attached. Keep in mind that this only specifies the size of the database data volume, the log volume for the database will be scaled appropriately with its shape. It is required if you are creating a new database. It cannot be set if you are creating a database from a backup.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) User-provided data about the DB System.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The user-friendly name for the DB System. It does not have to be unique.
* `fault_domain` - (Optional) The name of the Fault Domain the DB System is located in. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `hostname_label` - (Optional) The hostname for the primary endpoint of the DB System. Used for DNS.

	The value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, "dbsystem-1" in FQDN "dbsystem-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com").

	Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with RFC 952 and RFC 1123. 
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IP address the DB System is configured to listen on. A private IP address of your choice to assign to the primary endpoint of the DB System. Must be an available IP address within the subnet's CIDR. If you don't specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet. This should be a "dotted-quad" style IPv4 address. 
* `maintenance` - (Optional) (Updatable) `maintenance` and `backup_policy` cannot be updated in the same request.
	* `window_start_time` - (Required) (Updatable) The start of the 2 hour maintenance window.

		This string is of the format: "{day-of-week} {time-of-day}".

		"{day-of-week}" is a case-insensitive string like "mon", "tue", &c.

		"{time-of-day}" is the "Time" portion of an RFC3339-formatted timestamp. Any second or sub-second time data will be truncated to zero. 
* `mysql_version` - (Optional) The specific MySQL version identifier.
* `port` - (Optional) The port for primary endpoint of the DB System to listen on.
* `port_x` - (Optional) The TCP network port on which X Plugin listens for connections. This is the X Plugin equivalent of port. 
* `shape_name` - (Required) The name of the shape. The shape determines the resources allocated
	* CPU cores and memory for VM shapes; CPU cores, memory and storage for non-VM (or bare metal) shapes. To get a list of shapes, use the [ListShapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/mysql/20190415/ShapeSummary/ListShapes) operation. 
* `source` - (Optional) 
	* `backup_id` - (Required when source_type=BACKUP) The OCID of the backup to be used as the source for the new DB System. 
	* `source_type` - (Required) The specific source identifier. Use `BACKUP` for creating a new database by restoring from a backup.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The OCID of the subnet the DB System is associated with. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the DB System. Could be set to `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. 
* `shutdown_type` - (Optional) It is applicable only for stopping a DB System. Could be set to `FAST`, `SLOW` or `IMMEDIATE`. Default value is `FAST`.

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
