# oci_core_volume_backup_policy_assignment
This resource provides the Volume Backup Policy Assignment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Assigns a volume backup policy to the specified volume. Note that a given volume can
only have one backup policy assigned to it. If this operation is used for a volume that already
has a different backup policy assigned, the prior backup policy will be silently unassigned.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_volume_backup_policy_assignment" "test_volume_backup_policy_assignment" {
	#Required
	asset_id = oci_core_volume.test_volume.id
	policy_id = oci_core_volume_backup_policy.test_volume_backup_policy.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `asset_id` - (Required) The OCID of the volume to assign the policy to.
* `policy_id` - (Required) The OCID of the volume backup policy to assign to the volume.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `asset_id` - The OCID of the volume the policy has been assigned to.
* `id` - The OCID of the volume backup policy assignment.
* `policy_id` - The OCID of the volume backup policy that has been assigned to the volume.
* `time_created` - The date and time the volume backup policy was assigned to the volume. The format is defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). 

## Import

VolumeBackupPolicyAssignments can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_core_volume_backup_policy_assignment.test_volume_backup_policy_assignment "id"
```
