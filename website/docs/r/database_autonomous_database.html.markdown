* `db_workload` - (Optional) (Updatable) The Autonomous Database workload type. The following values are valid:
	* OLTP - indicates an Autonomous Transaction Processing database
	* DW - indicates an Autonomous Data Warehouse database
	* AJD - indicates an Autonomous JSON Database *Note: `db_workload` can only be updated from AJD to OLTP or from a free OLTP to AJD.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The user-friendly name for the Autonomous Database. The name does not have to be unique.

For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_auto_scaling_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates if auto scaling is enabled for the Autonomous Database OCPU core count. The default value is `FALSE`. 
* `is_data_guard_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether the Autonomous Database has Data Guard enabled.

Note that preview version software is only available for databases on [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI). 
* `is_refreshable_clone` - (Applicable when source=CLONE_TO_REFRESHABLE) (Updatable) True for creating a refreshable clone and False for detaching the clone from source Autonomous Database. Detaching is one time operation and clone becomes a regular Autonomous Database.
* `license_model` - (Optional) (Updatable) The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. Note that when provisioning an Autonomous Database on [dedicated Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adbddoverview.htm), this attribute must be null because the attribute is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When using [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI), if a value is not specified, the system will supply the value of `BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE`. It is a required field when `db_workload` is AJD and needs to be set to `LICENSE_INCLUDED` as AJD does not support default `license_model` value `BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE`.
* `nsg_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that this resource belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). **NsgIds restrictions:**
	* Autonomous Databases with private access require at least 1 Network Security Group (NSG). The nsgIds array cannot be empty. 
* `private_endpoint_label` - (Optional) (Updatable) The private endpoint label for the resource.
* `refreshable_mode` - (Applicable when source=CLONE_TO_REFRESHABLE) (Updatable) The refresh mode of the clone. AUTOMATIC indicates that the clone is automatically being refreshed with data from the source Autonomous Database.
* `source` - (Optional) The source of the database: Use `NONE` for creating a new Autonomous Database. Use `DATABASE` for creating a new Autonomous Database by cloning an existing Autonomous Database.

	For Autonomous Databases on [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI), the following cloning options are available: Use `BACKUP_FROM_ID` for creating a new Autonomous Database from a specified backup. Use `BACKUP_FROM_TIMESTAMP` for creating a point-in-time Autonomous Database clone using backups. For more information, see [Cloning an Autonomous Database](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/adbcloning.htm). 
* `source_id` - (Required when source=CLONE_TO_REFRESHABLE | DATABASE) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the source Autonomous Database that you will clone to create a new Autonomous Database.
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The current state of the Autonomous Database. Could be set to AVAILABLE or STOPPED
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the resource is associated with.

	**Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
	* For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.

	These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. 
* `timestamp` - (Required when source=BACKUP_FROM_TIMESTAMP) The timestamp specified for the point-in-time clone of the source Autonomous Database. The timestamp must be in the past.
* `whitelisted_ips` - (Optional) (Updatable) The client IP access control list (ACL). This feature is available for databases on [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI) only. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. This is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID.

	To add the whitelist VCN specific subnet or IP, use a semicoln ';' as a deliminator to add the VCN specific subnets or IPs. For update operation, if you wish to delete all the existing whitelisted IP’s, use an array with a single empty string entry. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.0.0/16"]` To remove all whitelisted IPs, set the field to a list with an empty string `[""]`.

* `switchover_to` - (Optional) It is applicable only when `is_data_guard_enabled` is true. Could be set to `PRIMARY` or `STANDBY`. Default value is `PRIMARY`.

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
