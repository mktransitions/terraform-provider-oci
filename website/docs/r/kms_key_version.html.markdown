# oci_kms_key_version
This resource provides the Key Version resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.

Generates a new [KeyVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/key/latest/KeyVersion/) resource that provides new cryptographic
material for a master encryption key. The key must be in an `ENABLED` state to be rotated.

As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to the total number
of requests across all  management write operations. Key Management might throttle this call to reject an
otherwise valid request when the total rate of management write operations exceeds 10 requests per second
for a given tenancy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_kms_key_version" "test_key_version" {
	#Required
	key_id = oci_kms_key.test_key.id
	management_endpoint = var.key_version_management_endpoint

	#Optional
	external_key_version_id = oci_kms_key_version.test_key_version.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `external_key_version_id` - (Optional) Key version ID associated with the external key.
* `key_id` - (Required) The OCID of the key.
* `management_endpoint` - (Required) The service endpoint to perform management operations against. Management operations include 'Create,' 'Update,' 'List,' 'Get,' and 'Delete' operations. See Vault Management endpoint.
* `time_of_deletion` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property for the deletion time of the key version, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2019-04-03T21:10:29.600Z`
* `schedule_deletion_days` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property used to define the number of days a deletion will be scheduled for. `time_of_deletion` takes precedence if set. Must be between 7 and 30 days. Default: `30`.

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains this key version.
* `external_key_reference_details` - Key reference data to be returned to the customer as a response.
	* `external_key_id` - ExternalKeyId refers to the globally unique key Id associated with the key created in external vault in CTM.
	* `external_key_version_id` - Key version ID associated with the external key.
* `id` - The OCID of the key version.
* `is_primary` - A Boolean value that indicates whether the KeyVersion belongs to primary Vault or replica Vault.
* `key_id` - The OCID of the master encryption key associated with this key version.
* `public_key` - The public key in PEM format. (This value pertains only to RSA and ECDSA keys.) 
* `replica_details` - KeyVersion replica details 
	* `replication_id` - ReplicationId associated with a key version operation 
* `restored_from_key_version_id` - The OCID of the key version from which this key version was restored.
* `schedule_deletion_days` - An optional property used to define the number of days a deletion will be scheduled for. `time_of_deletion` takes precedence if set. Must be between 7 and 30 days. Default: `30`.
* `state` - The key version's current lifecycle state.  Example: `ENABLED` 
* `time_created` - The date and time this key version was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format.  Example: "2018-04-03T21:10:29.600Z" 
* `time_of_deletion` - An optional property to indicate when to delete the key version, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2019-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `vault_id` - The OCID of the vault that contains this key version.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Key Version
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Key Version
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Key Version


## Import

KeyVersions can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_kms_key_version.test_key_version "managementEndpoint/{managementEndpoint}/keys/{keyId}/keyVersions/{keyVersionId}" 
```
