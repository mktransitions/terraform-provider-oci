  Creates and manages an OCI DbSystem
---

# oci_database_db_system
The `oci_database_db_system` resource creates and manages an OCI DbSystem

Launches a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability domain. The Oracle
Database edition that you specify applies to all the databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be changed.

An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request parameters you provide and some default
options. For more information,
see [Default Options for the Initial Database](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Database/Tasks/launchingDB.htm#DefaultOptionsfortheInitialDatabase).

The DB System will include a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to create additional databases and
manage existing databases. For more information, see the
[Oracle Database CLI Reference](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Database/References/odacli.htm#Oracle_Database_CLI_Reference).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain where the DB system is located.
* `backup_subnet_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup network subnet the DB system is associated with. Applicable only to Exadata DB systems.

	**Subnet Restrictions:** See the subnet restrictions information for **subnetId**. 
* `cluster_name` - (Optional) The cluster name for Exadata and 2-node RAC virtual machine DB systems. The cluster name must begin with an an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment the DB system  belongs in.
* `cpu_core_count` - (Optional) (Updatable) The number of CPU cores to enable for a bare metal or Exadata DB system. The valid values depend on the specified shape:
	* BM.DenseIO1.36 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 36.
	* BM.DenseIO2.52 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 52.
	* Exadata.Quarter1.84 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 22 to 84.
	* Exadata.Half1.168 - Specify a multiple of 4, from 44 to 168.

* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `hostname` - (Required) The hostname for the DB system. The hostname must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of 30 alphanumeric characters, including hyphens (-).

	The maximum length of the combined hostname and domain is 63 characters.

	**Note:** The hostname must be unique within the subnet. If it is not unique, the DB system will fail to provision. 
* `license_model` - (Optional) The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the DB system. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. Allowed values are: LICENSE_INCLUDED, BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE.
* `node_count` - (Optional) The number of nodes to launch for a 2-node RAC virtual machine DB system.

	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.

	These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.
