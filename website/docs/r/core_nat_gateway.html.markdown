# oci_core_nat_gateway
This resource provides the Nat Gateway resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new NAT gateway for the specified VCN. You must also set up a route rule with the
NAT gateway as the rule's target. See [Route Table](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/RouteTable/).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_nat_gateway" "test_nat_gateway" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id

	#Optional
	block_traffic = var.nat_gateway_block_traffic
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = var.nat_gateway_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `block_traffic` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the NAT gateway blocks traffic through it. The default is `false`.  Example: `true` 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to contain the NAT gateway. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `vcn_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VCN the gateway belongs to. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
