# oci_sch_service_connector
This resource provides the Service Connector resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Sch service.

Creates a new service connector in the specified compartment.
A service connector is a logically defined flow for moving data from
a source service to a destination service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
For general information about service connectors, see
[Service Connector Hub Overview](/iaas/service-connector-hub/using/index.htm).

For purposes of access control, you must provide the
[OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment where
you want the service connector to reside. Notice that the service connector
doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the source or target services.
For information about access control and compartments, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

After you send your request, the new service connector's state is temporarily
CREATING. When the state changes to ACTIVE, data begins transferring from the
source service to the target service. For instructions on deactivating and
activating service connectors, see
[To activate or deactivate a service connector](/iaas/service-connector-hub/using/index.htm).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_sch_service_connector" "test_service_connector" {
