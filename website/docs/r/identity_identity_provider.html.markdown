  Provides the Identity Provider resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service

# oci_identity_identity_provider
This resource provides the Identity Provider resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Creates a new identity provider in your tenancy. For more information, see
[Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).

You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request object.
Remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment. For information about
OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You must also specify a *name* for the `IdentityProvider`, which must be unique
across all `IdentityProvider` objects in your tenancy and cannot be changed.

You must also specify a *description* for the `IdentityProvider` (although
it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it anytime with
[UpdateIdentityProvider](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/IdentityProvider/UpdateIdentityProvider).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_identity_identity_provider" "test_identity_provider" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.tenancy_ocid}"
	description = "${var.identity_provider_description}"
	metadata = "${var.identity_provider_metadata}"
	metadata_url = "${var.identity_provider_metadata_url}"
	name = "${var.identity_provider_name}"
	product_type = "${var.identity_provider_product_type}"
	protocol = "${var.identity_provider_protocol}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_attributes = "${var.identity_provider_freeform_attributes}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of your tenancy.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Required) (Updatable) The description you assign to the `IdentityProvider` during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. 
* `freeform_attributes` - (Optional) (Updatable) Extra name value pairs associated with this identity provider. Example: `{"clientId": "app_sf3kdjf3"}` 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `metadata` - (Required) (Updatable) The XML that contains the information required for federating. 
* `metadata_url` - (Required) (Updatable) The URL for retrieving the identity provider's metadata, which contains information required for federating. 
* `name` - (Required) The name you assign to the `IdentityProvider` during creation. The name must be unique across all `IdentityProvider` objects in the tenancy and cannot be changed. 
* `product_type` - (Required) The identity provider service or product. Supported identity providers are Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) and Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).  Example: `IDCS` 
* `protocol` - (Required) (Updatable) The protocol used for federation.  Example: `SAML2` 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the tenancy containing the `IdentityProvider`.
