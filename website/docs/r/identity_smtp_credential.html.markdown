# oci_identity_smtp_credential
This resource provides the Smtp Credential resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Creates a new SMTP credential for the specified user. An SMTP credential has an SMTP user name and an SMTP password.
You must specify a *description* for the SMTP credential (although it can be an empty string). It does not
have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with
[UpdateSmtpCredential](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/SmtpCredentialSummary/UpdateSmtpCredential).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_identity_smtp_credential" "test_smtp_credential" {
	#Required
	description = "${var.smtp_credential_description}"
	user_id = "${oci_identity_user.test_user.id}"
}
```

* `description` - (Required) (Updatable) The description you assign to the SMTP credentials during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.

Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
