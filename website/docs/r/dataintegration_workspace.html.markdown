# oci_dataintegration_workspace
This resource provides the Workspace resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dataintegration service.

Creates a new Data Integration Workspace ready for performing data integration.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_dataintegration_workspace" "test_workspace" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.workspace_display_name

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.workspace_description
	dns_server_ip = var.workspace_dns_server_ip
	dns_server_zone = var.workspace_dns_server_zone
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_private_network_enabled = var.workspace_is_private_network_enabled
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id
	vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment containing the workspace.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A detailed description for the workspace.
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) A user-friendly display name for the workspace. Does not have to be unique, and can be modified. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `dns_server_ip` - (Optional) The IP of the custom DNS.
* `dns_server_zone` - (Optional) The DNS zone of the custom DNS to use to resolve names.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_private_network_enabled` - (Optional) Whether the private network connection is enabled or disabled.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the subnet for customer connected databases.
* `vcn_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the VCN the subnet is in.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
