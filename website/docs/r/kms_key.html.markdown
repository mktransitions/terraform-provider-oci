# oci_kms_key
This resource provides the Key resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.

Creates a new master encryption key.

As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to the total
number of requests across all management write operations. Key Management might throttle this call
to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of management write operations exceeds 10
requests per second for a given tenancy.
