## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `network_security_group_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security group.
* `security_rules` - (Optional) An array of security rules to add to the NSG. You can add up to 25 rules in a single `AddNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules` operation. Adding more than 25 rules requires multiple operations. 
	* `description` - (Optional) An optional description of your choice for the rule. Avoid entering confidential information. 
	* `destination` - (Optional) Conceptually, this is the range of IP addresses that a packet originating from the instance can go to.

		Allowed values:
		* An IP address range in CIDR notation. For example: `192.168.1.0/24` or `2001:0db8:0123:45::/56` IPv6 addressing is supported for all commercial and government regions. See [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).
		* The `cidrBlock` value for a [Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Service/), if you're setting up a security rule for traffic destined for a particular `Service` through a service gateway. For example: `oci-phx-objectstorage`.
		* The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/) in the same VCN. The value can be the NSG that the rule belongs to if the rule's intent is to control traffic between VNICs in the same NSG. 
	* `destination_type` - (Optional) Type of destination for the rule. Required if `direction` = `EGRESS`.

		Allowed values:
		* `CIDR_BLOCK`: If the rule's `destination` is an IP address range in CIDR notation.
		* `SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK`: If the rule's `destination` is the `cidrBlock` value for a [Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Service/) (the rule is for traffic destined for a particular `Service` through a service gateway).
		* `NETWORK_SECURITY_GROUP`: If the rule's `destination` is the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/). 
	* `direction` - (Required) Direction of the security rule. Set to `EGRESS` for rules to allow outbound IP packets, or `INGRESS` for rules to allow inbound IP packets. 
	* `icmp_options` - (Optional) Optional and valid only for ICMP and ICMPv6. Use to specify a particular ICMP type and code as defined in:
		* [ICMP Parameters](http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml)
		* [ICMPv6 Parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/icmpv6-parameters.xhtml)

		If you specify ICMP or ICMPv6 as the protocol but omit this object, then all ICMP types and codes are allowed. If you do provide this object, the type is required and the code is optional. To enable MTU negotiation for ingress internet traffic via IPv4, make sure to allow type 3 ("Destination Unreachable") code 4 ("Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set"). If you need to specify multiple codes for a single type, create a separate security list rule for each. 
		* `code` - (Optional) The ICMP code (optional).
		* `type` - (Required) The ICMP type.
	* `protocol` - (Required) The transport protocol. Specify either `all` or an IPv4 protocol number as defined in [Protocol Numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Options are supported only for ICMP ("1"), TCP ("6"), UDP ("17"), and ICMPv6 ("58"). 
	* `source` - (Optional) Conceptually, this is the range of IP addresses that a packet coming into the instance can come from.

		Allowed values:
		* An IP address range in CIDR notation. For example: `192.168.1.0/24` or `2001:0db8:0123:45::/56` IPv6 addressing is supported for all commercial and government regions. See [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).
		* The `cidrBlock` value for a [Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Service/), if you're setting up a security rule for traffic coming from a particular `Service` through a service gateway. For example: `oci-phx-objectstorage`.
		* The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/) in the same VCN. The value can be the NSG that the rule belongs to if the rule's intent is to control traffic between VNICs in the same NSG. 
	* `source_type` - (Optional) Type of source for the rule. Required if `direction` = `INGRESS`.
		* `CIDR_BLOCK`: If the rule's `source` is an IP address range in CIDR notation.
		* `SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK`: If the rule's `source` is the `cidrBlock` value for a [Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Service/) (the rule is for traffic coming from a particular `Service` through a service gateway).
		* `NETWORK_SECURITY_GROUP`: If the rule's `source` is the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/). 
	* `stateless` - (Optional) A stateless rule allows traffic in one direction. Remember to add a corresponding stateless rule in the other direction if you need to support bidirectional traffic. For example, if egress traffic allows TCP destination port 80, there should be an ingress rule to allow TCP source port 80. Defaults to false, which means the rule is stateful and a corresponding rule is not necessary for bidirectional traffic. 
	* `tcp_options` - (Optional) Optional and valid only for TCP. Use to specify particular destination ports for TCP rules. If you specify TCP as the protocol but omit this object, then all destination ports are allowed. 
		* `destination_port_range` - (Optional) 
			* `max` - (Required) The maximum port number, which must not be less than the minimum port number. To specify a single port number, set both the min and max to the same value. 
			* `min` - (Required) The minimum port number, which must not be greater than the maximum port number. 
		* `source_port_range` - (Optional) 
			* `max` - (Required) The maximum port number, which must not be less than the minimum port number. To specify a single port number, set both the min and max to the same value. 
			* `min` - (Required) The minimum port number, which must not be greater than the maximum port number.
