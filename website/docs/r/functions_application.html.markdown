# oci_functions_application
This resource provides the Application resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Functions service.

Creates a new application.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_functions_application" "test_application" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	display_name = "${var.application_display_name}"
	subnet_ids = "${var.application_subnet_ids}"

	#Optional
	config = "${var.application_config}"
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment to create the application within. 
* `config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Application configuration. These values are passed on to the function as environment variables, functions may override application configuration. Keys must be ASCII strings consisting solely of letters, digits, and the '_' (underscore) character, and must not begin with a digit. Values should be limited to printable unicode characters.  Example: `{"MY_FUNCTION_CONFIG": "ConfVal"}`

	The maximum size for all configuration keys and values is limited to 4KB. This is measured as the sum of octets necessary to represent each key and value in UTF-8. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Required) The display name of the application. The display name must be unique within the compartment containing the application. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `subnet_ids` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)s of the subnets in which to run functions in the application. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the application. 
* `config` - Application configuration for functions in this application (passed as environment variables). Can be overridden by function configuration. Keys must be ASCII strings consisting solely of letters, digits, and the '_' (underscore) character, and must not begin with a digit. Values should be limited to printable unicode characters.  Example: `{"MY_FUNCTION_CONFIG": "ConfVal"}`

	The maximum size for all configuration keys and values is limited to 4KB. This is measured as the sum of octets necessary to represent each key and value in UTF-8. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - The display name of the application. The display name is unique within the compartment containing the application. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the application. 
* `state` - The current state of the application. 
* `subnet_ids` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)s of the subnets in which to run functions in the application. 
* `time_created` - The time the application was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format.  Example: `2018-09-12T22:47:12.613Z` 
* `time_updated` - The time the application was updated, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2018-09-12T22:47:12.613Z` 

## Import

Applications can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_functions_application.test_application "id"
```
