# oci_core_cross_connect_group
This resource provides the Cross Connect Group resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new cross-connect group to use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
FastConnect. For more information, see
[FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the cross-connect group to reside. If you're
not sure which compartment to use, put the cross-connect group in the
same compartment with your VCN. For more information about
compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
For information about OCIDs, see
[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect group.
It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_cross_connect_group" "test_cross_connect_group" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	customer_reference_name = "${var.cross_connect_group_customer_reference_name}"
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.cross_connect_group_display_name}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment to contain the cross-connect group.
* `customer_reference_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A reference name or identifier for the physical fiber connection that this cross-connect group uses. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
