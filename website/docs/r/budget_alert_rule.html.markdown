	threshold = var.alert_rule_threshold
	threshold_type = var.alert_rule_threshold_type
	type = var.alert_rule_type

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.alert_rule_description
	display_name = var.alert_rule_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	message = var.alert_rule_message

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `budget_id` - (Required) The unique Budget OCID
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the alert rule.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The name of the alert rule.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `message` - (Optional) (Updatable) The message to be sent to the recipients when alert rule is triggered.
* `recipients` - (Optional) (Updatable) The audience that will receive the alert when it triggers. An empty string is interpreted as null.
* `threshold` - (Required) (Updatable) The threshold for triggering the alert expressed as a whole number or decimal value. If thresholdType is ABSOLUTE, threshold can have at most 12 digits before the decimal point and up to 2 digits after the decimal point. If thresholdType is PERCENTAGE, the maximum value is 10000 and can have up to 2 digits after the decimal point. 
* `threshold_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of threshold.
* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) Type of alert. Valid values are ACTUAL (the alert will trigger based on actual usage) or FORECAST (the alert will trigger based on predicted usage).
