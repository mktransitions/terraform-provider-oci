# oci_datascience_model
This resource provides the Model resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Datascience service.

Creates a new model.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_datascience_model" "test_model" {
	#Required
	artifact_content_length = var.artifact_content_length
    model_artifact = var.model_artifact
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	project_id = oci_datascience_project.test_project.id

	#Optional
	artifact_content_disposition = var.content_disposition 
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.model_description
	display_name = var.model_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `artifact_content_length` - (Required) The length of the artifact to upload.
* `artifact_content_disposition` - (Optional) The content disposition of the artifact to upload.
* `model_artifact` - (Required) The model artifact to upload.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to create the model in.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A short blurb describing the model.
