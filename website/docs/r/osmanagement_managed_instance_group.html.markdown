# oci_osmanagement_managed_instance_group
This resource provides the Managed Instance Group resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Osmanagement service.

Creates a new Managed Instance Group on the management system.
This will not contain any managed instances after it is first created,
and they must be added later.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_osmanagement_managed_instance_group" "test_managed_instance_group" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.managed_instance_group_display_name

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.managed_instance_group_description
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	os_family = var.managed_instance_group_os_family
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) OCID for the Compartment
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Information specified by the user about the managed instance group
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) Managed Instance Group identifier
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `os_family` - (Optional) The Operating System type of the managed instance(s) on which this scheduled job will operate. If not specified, this defaults to Linux. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
