# oci_identity_customer_secret_key
This resource provides the Customer Secret Key resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Creates a new secret key for the specified user. Secret keys are used for authentication with the Object Storage Service's Amazon S3
compatible API. For information, see
[Managing User Credentials](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm).

You must specify a *description* for the secret key (although it can be an empty string). It does not
have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with
[UpdateCustomerSecretKey](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/CustomerSecretKeySummary/UpdateCustomerSecretKey).

Every user has permission to create a secret key for *their own user ID*. An administrator in your organization
does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the
tenancy can use this operation to create a secret key for any user, including themselves.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_identity_customer_secret_key" "test_customer_secret_key" {
	#Required
	display_name = "${var.customer_secret_key_display_name}"
	user_id = "${oci_identity_user.test_user.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) The name you assign to the secret key during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. 
* `user_id` - (Required) The OCID of the user.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
