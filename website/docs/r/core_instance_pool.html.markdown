# oci_core_instance_pool
This resource provides the Instance Pool resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Create an instance pool.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_instance_pool" "test_instance_pool" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	instance_configuration_id = "${oci_core_instance_configuration.test_instance_configuration.id}"
	placement_configurations {
		#Required
		availability_domain = "${var.instance_pool_placement_configurations_availability_domain}"
		primary_subnet_id = "${oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id}"

		#Optional
		secondary_vnic_subnets {
			#Required
			subnet_id = "${oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id}"

			#Optional
			display_name = "${var.instance_pool_placement_configurations_secondary_vnic_subnets_display_name}"
		}
	}
	size = "${var.instance_pool_size}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.instance_pool_display_name}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	load_balancers {
		#Required
		backend_set_name = "${oci_load_balancer_backend_set.test_backend_set.name}"
		load_balancer_id = "${oci_load_balancer_load_balancer.test_load_balancer.id}"
		port = "${var.instance_pool_load_balancers_port}"
		vnic_selection = "${var.instance_pool_load_balancers_vnic_selection}"
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment containing the instance pool
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name for the instance pool. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `instance_configuration_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the instance configuration associated with the instance pool.
* `load_balancers` - (Optional) The load balancers to attach to the instance pool. 
	* `backend_set_name` - (Required) The name of the backend set on the load balancer to add instances to.
	* `load_balancer_id` - (Required) The OCID of the load balancer to attach to the instance pool.
	* `port` - (Required) The port value to use when creating the backend set.
	* `vnic_selection` - (Required) Indicates which VNIC on each instance in the pool should be used to associate with the load balancer. Possible values are "PrimaryVnic" or the displayName of one of the secondary VNICs on the instance configuration that is associated with the instance pool.
* `placement_configurations` - (Required) (Updatable) The placement configurations for the instance pool. Provide one placement configuration for each availability domain.

	To use the instance pool with a regional subnet, provide a placement configuration for each availability domain, and include the regional subnet in each placement configuration. 
	* `availability_domain` - (Required) (Updatable) The availability domain to place instances. Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
	* `primary_subnet_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the primary subnet to place instances.
	* `secondary_vnic_subnets` - (Optional) (Updatable) The set of secondary VNIC data for instances in the pool.
		* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The displayName of the vnic. This is also use to match against the Instance Configuration defined secondary vnic. 
		* `subnet_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The subnet OCID for the secondary vnic
* `size` - (Required) (Updatable) The number of instances that should be in the instance pool. Modifying this value will override the size of the instance pool. If the instance pool is linked with autoscaling configuration, autoscaling configuration could resize the instance pool at a later point. The instance pool's actual size may differ from the configured size if it is associated with an autoscaling configuration. For the actual size of the instance pool, refer to the `actual_size` attribute. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the instance pool. Could be set to RUNNING or STOPPED.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the instance pool.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name.  Does not have to be unique.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the instance pool.

## Import

InstancePools can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_core_instance_pool.test_instance_pool "id"
```
