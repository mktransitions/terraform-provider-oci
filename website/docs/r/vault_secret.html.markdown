# oci_vault_secret
This resource provides the Secret resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault service.

Creates a new secret according to the details of the request.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_vault_secret" "test_secret" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	secret_content {
		#Required
		content_type = var.secret_secret_content_content_type
		content = var.secret_secret_content_content

		#Optional
		name = var.secret_secret_content_name
		stage = var.secret_secret_content_stage
	}
	secret_name = oci_vault_secret.test_secret.name
	vault_id = oci_kms_vault.test_vault.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.secret_description
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}

	metadata = var.secret_metadata
	secret_rules {
		#Required
		rule_type = var.secret_secret_rules_rule_type

		#Optional
		is_enforced_on_deleted_secret_versions = var.secret_secret_rules_is_enforced_on_deleted_secret_versions
		is_secret_content_retrieval_blocked_on_expiry = var.secret_secret_rules_is_secret_content_retrieval_blocked_on_expiry

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment where you want to create the secret.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A brief description of the secret. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `key_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the master encryption key that is used to encrypt the secret.
* `metadata` - (Optional) (Updatable) Additional metadata that you can use to provide context about how to use the secret during rotation or other administrative tasks. For example, for a secret that you use to connect to a database, the additional metadata might specify the connection endpoint and the connection string. Provide additional metadata as key-value pairs. 
* `secret_content` - (Required) (Updatable) The content of the secret and metadata to help identify it.
	* `content` - (Required) (Updatable) The base64-encoded content of the secret.
	* `content_type` - (Required) (Updatable) content type . Example `BASE64` .
	* `name` - (Optional) (Updatable) Names should be unique within a secret. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
	* `stage` - (Optional) (Updatable) The rotation state of the secret content. The default is `CURRENT`, meaning that the secret is currently in use. A secret version that you mark as `PENDING` is staged and available for use, but you don't yet want to rotate it into current, active use. For example, you might create or update a secret and mark its rotation state as `PENDING` if you haven't yet updated the secret on the target system. When creating a secret, only the value `CURRENT` is applicable, although the value `LATEST` is also automatically applied. When updating  a secret, you can specify a version's rotation state as either `CURRENT` or `PENDING`. 
* `secret_name` - (Required) A user-friendly name for the secret. Secret names should be unique within a vault. Avoid entering confidential information. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods. 
* `secret_rules` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of rules to control how the secret is used and managed.
	* `is_enforced_on_deleted_secret_versions` - (Applicable when rule_type=SECRET_REUSE_RULE) (Updatable) A property indicating whether the rule is applied even if the secret version with the content you are trying to reuse was deleted. 
	* `is_secret_content_retrieval_blocked_on_expiry` - (Applicable when rule_type=SECRET_EXPIRY_RULE) (Updatable) A property indicating whether to block retrieval of the secret content, on expiry. The default is false. If the secret has already expired and you would like to retrieve the secret contents, you need to edit the secret rule to disable this property, to allow reading the secret content. 
	* `rule_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of rule, which either controls when the secret contents expire or whether they can be reused.
	* `secret_version_expiry_interval` - (Applicable when rule_type=SECRET_EXPIRY_RULE) (Updatable) A property indicating how long the secret contents will be considered valid, expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals) format. The secret needs to be updated when the secret content expires. No enforcement mechanism exists at this time, but audit logs record the expiration on the appropriate date, according to the time interval specified in the rule. The timer resets after you update the secret contents. The minimum value is 1 day and the maximum value is 90 days for this property. Currently, only intervals expressed in days are supported. For example, pass `P3D` to have the secret version expire every 3 days. 
	* `time_of_absolute_expiry` - (Applicable when rule_type=SECRET_EXPIRY_RULE) (Updatable) An optional property indicating the absolute time when this secret will expire, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. The minimum number of days from current time is 1 day and the maximum number of days from current time is 365 days. Example: `2019-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `vault_id` - (Required) The OCID of the vault where you want to create the secret.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
