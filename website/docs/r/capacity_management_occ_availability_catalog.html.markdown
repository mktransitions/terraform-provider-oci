# oci_capacity_management_occ_availability_catalog
This resource provides the Occ Availability Catalog resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Capacity Management service.

Create availability catalog

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_capacity_management_occ_availability_catalog" "test_occ_availability_catalog" {
	#Required
	base64encoded_catalog_details = var.occ_availability_catalog_base64encoded_catalog_details
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.occ_availability_catalog_display_name
	namespace = var.occ_availability_catalog_namespace
	occ_customer_group_id = oci_capacity_management_occ_customer_group.test_occ_customer_group.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.occ_availability_catalog_description
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	metadata_details {
		#Required
		format_version = var.occ_availability_catalog_metadata_details_format_version
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `base64encoded_catalog_details` - (Required) The base 64 encoded string corresponding to the catalog file contents.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) Since all resources are at tenancy level hence this will be the ocid of the tenancy where operation is to be performed.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Additional information about the availability catalog.
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) The display name of the availability catalog.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `metadata_details` - (Optional) Used for representing the metadata of the catalog. This denotes the version and format of the CSV file for parsing.
	* `format_version` - (Required) The version for the format of the catalog file being uploaded.
* `namespace` - (Required) The name of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service in consideration. For example, Compute, Exadata, and so on.
* `occ_customer_group_id` - (Required) The OCID of the customer group.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Occ Availability Catalog
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Occ Availability Catalog
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Occ Availability Catalog


## Import

OccAvailabilityCatalogs can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_capacity_management_occ_availability_catalog.test_occ_availability_catalog "id"
```
