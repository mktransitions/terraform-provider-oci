# oci_identity_auth_token
This resource provides the Auth Token resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Creates a new auth token for the specified user. For information about what auth tokens are for, see
[Managing User Credentials](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm).

You must specify a *description* for the auth token (although it can be an empty string). It does not
have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with
[UpdateAuthToken](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/AuthToken/UpdateAuthToken).

Every user has permission to create an auth token for *their own user ID*. An administrator in your organization
does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the
tenancy can use this operation to create an auth token for any user, including themselves.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_identity_auth_token" "test_auth_token" {
	#Required
	description = "${var.auth_token_description}"
	user_id = "${oci_identity_user.test_user.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Required) (Updatable) The description you assign to the auth token during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. 
* `user_id` - (Required) The OCID of the user.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
