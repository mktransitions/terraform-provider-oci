# oci_ons_notification_topic
This resource provides the Notification Topic resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ons service.

Creates a topic in the specified compartment. For general information about topics, see
[Managing Topics and Subscriptions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/managingtopicsandsubscriptions.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the topic to reside.
For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

You must specify a display name for the topic.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including topics, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an
Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the
Console. Fore more information, see [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	name = "${var.notification_topic_name}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = "${var.notification_topic_description}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
