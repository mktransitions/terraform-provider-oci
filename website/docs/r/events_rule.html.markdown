# oci_events_rule
This resource provides the Rule resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Events service.

Creates a new rule.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_events_rule" "test_rule" {
	#Required
	actions {
		#Required
		actions {
			#Required
			action_type = "${var.rule_actions_actions_action_type}"
			is_enabled = "${var.rule_actions_actions_is_enabled}"

			#Optional
			description = "${var.rule_actions_actions_description}"
			function_id = "${oci_functions_function.test_function.id}"
			stream_id = "${oci_streaming_stream.test_stream.id}"
			topic_id = "${oci_ons_notification_topic.test_topic.id}"
		}
	}
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	condition = "${var.rule_condition}"
	display_name = "${var.rule_display_name}"
	is_enabled = "${var.rule_is_enabled}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = "${var.rule_description}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `actions` - (Required) (Updatable) 
	* `actions` - (Required) (Updatable) A list of one or more ActionDetails objects. 
		* `action_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The action to perform if the condition in the rule matches an event.
			* **ONS:** Send to an Oracle Notification Service topic.
			* **OSS:** Send to a stream from Oracle Streaming Service.
			* **FAAS:** Send to an Oracle Functions Service endpoint. 
		* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A string that describes the details of the action. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information. 
		* `function_id` - (Applicable when action_type=FAAS) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a Function hosted by Oracle Functions Service. 
		* `is_enabled` - (Required) (Updatable) Whether or not this action is currently enabled.  Example: `true` 
		* `stream_id` - (Required when action_type=OSS) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the stream to which messages are delivered. 
		* `topic_id` - (Applicable when action_type=ONS) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the topic to which messages are delivered. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to which this rule belongs. 
* `condition` - (Required) (Updatable) A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few  important things to remember about filters:
	* Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches all events with two curly brackets: `{}` 

	For more examples, see  [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).       
	* For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names  listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting  structure used in the event. 

	For a list of reference events, see  [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).       
	* Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments.  This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in  the compartment or any of its child compartments. 
	* The condition is a string value in a JSON object, but numbers in conditions are converted  from strings to numbers before they are evaluated for matches. This means that 100, 100.0 or  1.0e2 are all considered equal.
	* Boolean values are converted to numbers and then evaluated. This means true and True are  considered equal, as are False and false. 
	* Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (*) character. 

	For examples of wildcard matching, see  [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

	Example: `\"eventType\": \"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\"` 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A string that describes the details of the rule. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) A string that describes the rule. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross-compatibility only. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_enabled` - (Required) (Updatable) Whether or not this rule is currently enabled.  Example: `true` 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
