# oci_kms_encrypted_data
The `oci_kms_encrypted_data` resource creates and manages an OCI EncryptedData

Encrypts data using the given EncryptDataDetails resource. 
Plaintext included in the example request is a base64-encoded value 
of a UTF-8 string.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_kms_encrypted_data" "test_encrypted_data" {
	#Required
	crypto_endpoint = "${var.encrypted_data_crypto_endpoint}"
	key_id = "${oci_kms_key.test_key.id}"
	plaintext = "${var.encrypted_data_plaintext}"

	#Optional
	associated_data = "${var.encrypted_data_associated_data}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `associated_data` - (Optional) Information that can be used to provide an encryption context for the encrypted data. The length of the string representation of the associatedData must be fewer than 4096 characters. 
* `crypto_endpoint` - (Required) The service endpoint to perform cryptographic operations against. Cryptographic operations include 'Encrypt,' 'Decrypt,' and 'GenerateDataEncryptionKey' operations. see Vault Crypto endpoint.
* `key_id` - (Required) The OCID of the key to encrypt with.
* `plaintext` - (Required) The plaintext data to encrypt.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
