# oci_core_ipsec_connection_tunnel_management
This resource provides the Ip Sec Connection Tunnel Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Updates the specified tunnel. This operation lets you change tunnel attributes such as the
routing type (BGP dynamic routing or static routing). Here are some important notes:

	* If you change the tunnel's routing type or BGP session configuration, the tunnel will go
	down while it's reprovisioned.

	* If you want to switch the tunnel's `routing` from `STATIC` to `BGP`, make sure the tunnel's
	BGP session configuration attributes have been set ([bgpSessionConfig](#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/BgpSessionInfo)).

	* If you want to switch the tunnel's `routing` from `BGP` to `STATIC`, make sure the
	[IPSecConnection](#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/) already has at least one valid CIDR
	static route.

** IMPORTANT **
Destroying `the oci_core_ipsec_connection_tunnel_management` leaves the resource in its existing state. It will not destroy the tunnel and it will not return the tunnel to its default values.

## Example Usage

```hcl
"oci_core_ipsec_connection_tunnel_management" "test_ip_sec_connection_tunnel" {
	#Required
	ipsec_id = "${oci_core_ipsec.test_ipsec.id}"
	tunnel_id = "${oci_core_tunnel.test_tunnel.id}"
	routing = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_routing}"
	#Optional
	bgp_session_info {
		#Optional
		customer_bgp_asn = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_bgp_session_info_customer_bgp_asn}"
		customer_interface_ip = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_bgp_session_info_customer_interface_ip}"
		oracle_interface_ip = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_bgp_session_info_oracle_interface_ip}"
	}
	display_name = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_display_name}"
	shared_secret = "${var.ip_sec_connection_tunnel_management_shared_secret}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ipsec_id` - (Required) The OCID of the IPSec connection.
* `tunnel_id` - (Required) The OCID of the IPSec connection's tunnel.
* `routing` - (Required) The type of routing to use for this tunnel (either BGP dynamic routing or static routing). 
* `bgp_session_info` - (Optional) Information for establishing a BGP session for the IPSec tunnel. Required if the tunnel uses BGP dynamic routing.

	If the tunnel instead uses static routing, you may optionally provide this object and set an IP address for one or both ends of the IPSec tunnel for the purposes of troubleshooting or monitoring the tunnel. 
	* `customer_bgp_asn` - (Optional) If the tunnel's `routing` attribute is set to `BGP` (see [IPSecConnectionTunnel](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionTunnel/)), this ASN is required and used for the tunnel's BGP session. This is the ASN of the network on the CPE end of the BGP session. Can be a 2-byte or 4-byte ASN. Uses "asplain" format.

		If the tunnel's `routing` attribute is set to `STATIC`, the `customerBgpAsn` must be null.

		Example: `12345` (2-byte) or `1587232876` (4-byte) 
	* `customer_interface_ip` - (Optional) The IP address for the CPE end of the inside tunnel interface.

		If the tunnel's `routing` attribute is set to `BGP` (see [IPSecConnectionTunnel](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionTunnel/)), this IP address is required and used for the tunnel's BGP session.

		If `routing` is instead set to `STATIC`, this IP address is optional. You can set this IP address to troubleshoot or monitor the tunnel.

		The value must be a /30 or /31.

		Example: `10.0.0.5/31` 
	* `oracle_interface_ip` - (Optional) The IP address for the Oracle end of the inside tunnel interface.

		If the tunnel's `routing` attribute is set to `BGP` (see [IPSecConnectionTunnel](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionTunnel/)), this IP address is required and used for the tunnel's BGP session.

		If `routing` is instead set to `STATIC`, this IP address is optional. You can set this IP address to troubleshoot or monitor the tunnel.

		The value must be a /30 or /31.

		Example: `10.0.0.4/31` 
  * `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
  * `shared_secret` - (Optional) The shared secret (pre-shared key) to use for the IPSec tunnel. If you don't provide a value, Oracle generates a value for you. You can specify your own shared secret later if you like with [UpdateIPSecConnectionTunnelSharedSecret](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionTunnelSharedSecret/UpdateIPSecConnectionTunnelSharedSecret).  Example: `EXAMPLEToUis6j1c.p8G.dVQxcmdfMO0yXMLi.lZTbYCMDGu4V8o`

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `bgp_session_info` - Information needed to establish a BGP Session on an interface. 
	* `bgp_state` - the state of the BGP. 
	* `customer_bgp_asn` - This is the value of the remote Bgp ASN in asplain format, as a string. Example: 1587232876 (4 byte ASN) or 12345 (2 byte ASN) 
	* `customer_interface_ip` - This is the IPv4 Address used in the BGP peering session for the non-Oracle router. Example: 10.0.0.2/31 
	* `oracle_bgp_asn` - This is the value of the Oracle Bgp ASN in asplain format, as a string. Example: 1587232876 (4 byte ASN) or 12345 (2 byte ASN) 
	* `oracle_interface_ip` - This is the IPv4 Address used in the BGP peering session for the Oracle router. Example: 10.0.0.1/31 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the tunnel.
* `cpe_ip` - The IP address of Cpe headend.  Example: `129.146.17.50`
