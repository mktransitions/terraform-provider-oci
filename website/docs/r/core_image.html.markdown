# oci_core_image
This resource provides the Image resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a boot disk image for the specified instance or imports an exported image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.

When creating a new image, you must provide the OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image, and
the OCID of the compartment containing that instance. For more information about images,
see [Managing Custom Images](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm).

When importing an exported image from Object Storage, you specify the source information
in [ImageSourceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceDetails).

When importing an image based on the namespace, bucket name, and object name,
use [ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails).

When importing an image based on the Object Storage URL, use
[ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails).
See [Object Storage URLs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#URLs) and [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)
for constructing URLs for image import/export.

For more information about importing exported images, see
[Image Import/Export](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the image, which is simply a friendly name or description.
It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. See [UpdateImage](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Image/UpdateImage).
Avoid entering confidential information.


## Example Usage

### Create image from instance in tenancy
```hcl
resource "oci_core_image" "test_image" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	instance_id = "${oci_core_instance.test_instance.id}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.image_display_name}"
	launch_mode = "${var.image_launch_mode}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

### Create image from exported image via direct access to object store 
```hcl
resource "oci_core_image" "test_image" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.image_display_name}"
	launch_mode = "${var.image_launch_mode}"
	
	image_source_details {
		source_type = "objectStorageTuple"
		bucket_name = "${var.bucket_name}"
		namespace_name = "${var.namespace}"
		object_name = "${var.object_name}" # exported image name
        
		#Optional
		source_image_type = "${var.source_image_type}"
	}
}
```

### Create image from exported image at publicly accessible uri  
```hcl
resource "oci_core_image" "test_image" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.image_display_name}"
	launch_mode = "${var.image_launch_mode}"
	
	image_source_details {
		source_type = "objectStorageUri"
		source_uri = "${var.source_uri}" 

		#Optional
		source_image_type = "${var.source_image_type}"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment you want the image to be created in.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name for the image. It does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

	    * `QCOW2`
	    * `VMDK`
	* `source_type` - (Required) The source type for the image. Use `objectStorageTuple` when specifying the namespace, bucket name, and object name. Use `objectStorageUri` when specifying the Object Storage URL. 
	* `source_uri` - (Required when source_type=objectStorageUri) The Object Storage URL for the image.
* `instance_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image.
