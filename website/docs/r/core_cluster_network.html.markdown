# oci_core_cluster_network
This resource provides the Cluster Network resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Create a cluster network.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_cluster_network" "test_cluster_network" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	instance_pools {
		#Required
		instance_configuration_id = "${oci_core_instance_configuration.test_instance_configuration.id}"
		size = "${var.cluster_network_instance_pools_size}"

		#Optional
		defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
		display_name = "${var.cluster_network_instance_pools_display_name}"
		freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	}
	placement_configuration {
		#Required
		availability_domain = "${var.cluster_network_placement_configuration_availability_domain}"
		primary_subnet_id = "${oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id}"

		#Optional
		secondary_vnic_subnets {
			#Required
			subnet_id = "${oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id}"

			#Optional
			display_name = "${var.cluster_network_placement_configuration_secondary_vnic_subnets_display_name}"
		}
	}

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment containing the cluster network.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The user-friendly name.  Does not have to be unique.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `instance_pools` - (Required) the data to create the instance pools in the cluster network.
	* `compartment_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment containing the instance pool.
	* `defined_tags` - (Optional) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
	* `display_name` - (Optional) The user-friendly name.  Does not have to be unique.
	* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
	* `instance_configuration_id` - (Required) The OCID of the instance configuration associated to the instance pool.
	* `size` - (Required) The number of instances that should be in the instance pool.
* `placement_configuration` - (Required) the placement data for the instance pools in the cluster network
	* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain to place instances. Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
	* `primary_subnet_id` - (Required) The OCID of the primary subnet to place instances.
	* `secondary_vnic_subnets` - (Optional) The set of secondary VNIC data for instances in the pool.
		* `display_name` - (Optional) The display name of the vnic. This is also use to match against the Instance Configuration defined secondary vnic. 
		* `subnet_id` - (Required) The subnet OCID for the secondary vnic


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
