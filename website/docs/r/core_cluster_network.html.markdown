			To distribute the instances evenly across selected fault domains, provide a set of fault domains. For example, you might want instances to be evenly distributed if your applications require high availability.

			To get a list of fault domains, use the [ListFaultDomains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains) operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
