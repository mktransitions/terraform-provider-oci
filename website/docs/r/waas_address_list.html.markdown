# oci_waas_address_list
This resource provides the Address List resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Web Application Acceleration and Security service.

Creates an address list in a set compartment and allows it to be used in a WAAS policy and referenced by access rules. Addresses can be IP addresses and CIDR notations.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_waas_address_list" "test_address_list" {
	#Required
	addresses = var.address_list_addresses
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.address_list_display_name

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```
