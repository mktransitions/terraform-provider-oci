# oci_objectstorage_object
This resource provides the Object resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.

Creates a new object or overwrites an existing object with the same name. The maximum object size allowed by
PutObject is 50 GiB.

See [Object Names](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects.htm#namerequirements)
for object naming requirements. 

See [Special Instructions for Object Storage PUT](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/signingrequests.htm#ObjectStoragePut)
for request signature requirements.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_objectstorage_object" "test_object" {
	#Required
	bucket = var.object_bucket
	content = var.object_content
	namespace = var.object_namespace
	object = var.object_object

	#Optional
	cache_control = var.object_cache_control
	content_disposition = var.object_content_disposition
	content_encoding = var.object_content_encoding
	content_language = var.object_content_language
	content_type = var.object_content_type
	delete_all_object_versions = var.object_delete_all_object_versions
	metadata = var.object_metadata
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: `my-new-bucket1` 
* `cache_control` - (Optional) The cache-control header value to be returned in GetObjectResponse.
* `content` - (Optional) The object to upload to the object store. Cannot be defined if `source` or `source_uri_details` is defined.
* `content_disposition` - (Optional) The Content-Disposition header value to be returned in GetObjectResponse.
* `content_encoding` - (Optional) The content encoding of the object.
* `content_language` - (Optional) The content language of the object.
* `content_md5` - (Optional) The optional base-64 header that defines the encoded MD5 hash of the body. If the optional Content-MD5 header is present, Object Storage performs an integrity check on the body of the HTTP request by computing the MD5 hash for the body and comparing it to the MD5 hash supplied in the header. If the two hashes do not match, the object is rejected and an HTTP-400 Unmatched Content MD5 error is returned with the message:
"The computed MD5 of the request body (ACTUAL_MD5) does not match the Content-MD5 header (HEADER_MD5)".

    This supports either base64-encoded or hex-encoded checksums.
* `content_type` - (Optional) The content type of the object.  Defaults to 'application/octet-stream' if not overridden during the PutObject call.
* `delete_all_object_versions` - (Optional) (Updatable) A boolean to delete all object versions for an object in a bucket that has or ever had versioning enabled.
* `metadata` - (Optional) Optional user-defined metadata key and value.
Note: All specified keys must be in lower case.
* `namespace` - (Required) The Object Storage namespace used for the request.
* `object` - (Required) (Updatable) The name of the object. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: `test/object1.log` 
* `source` - (Optional) An absolute path to a file on the local system. Cannot be defined if `content` or `source_uri_details` is defined.
* `source_uri_details` - (Optional) Details of the source URI of the object in the cloud. Cannot be defined if `content` or `source` is defined. 
Note: To enable object copy, you must authorize the service to manage objects on your behalf.
    * `region` - (Required) The region of the source object.
    * `namespace` - (Required) The top-level namespace of the source object.
    * `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket for the source object.
    * `object` - (Required) The name of the source object.
    * `source_object_if_match_etag` - (Optional) The entity tag to match the source object.
    * `destination_object_if_match_etag` - (Optional) The entity tag to match the target object.
    * `destination_object_if_none_match_etag` - (Optional) The entity tag to not match the target object.
    * `source_version_id` - (Optional) The version id of the object to be restored.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
