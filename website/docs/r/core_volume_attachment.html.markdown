# oci_core_volume_attachment
This resource provides the Volume Attachment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Attaches the specified storage volume to the specified instance.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_volume_attachment" "test_volume_attachment" {
	#Required
	attachment_type = var.volume_attachment_attachment_type
	instance_id = oci_core_instance.test_instance.id
	volume_id = oci_core_volume.test_volume.id

	#Optional
	device = var.volume_attachment_device
	display_name = var.volume_attachment_display_name
	is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled = var.volume_attachment_is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled
	is_read_only = var.volume_attachment_is_read_only
	is_shareable = var.volume_attachment_is_shareable
	use_chap = var.volume_attachment_use_chap
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `attachment_type` - (Required) The type of volume. The only supported values are "iscsi" and "paravirtualized".
* `device` - (Optional) The device name.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it cannot be changed. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `instance_id` - (Required) The OCID of the instance.
* `is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled` - (Applicable when attachment_type=paravirtualized) Whether to enable in-transit encryption for the data volume's paravirtualized attachment. The default value is false.
* `is_read_only` - (Optional) Whether the attachment was created in read-only mode.
* `is_shareable` - (Optional) Whether the attachment should be created in shareable mode. If an attachment is created in shareable mode, then other instances can attach the same volume, provided that they also create their attachments in shareable mode. Only certain volume types can be attached in shareable mode. Defaults to false if not specified. 
* `use_chap` - (Applicable when attachment_type=iscsi) Whether to use CHAP authentication for the volume attachment. Defaults to false.
* `volume_id` - (Required) The OCID of the volume.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `attachment_type` - The type of volume attachment.
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of an instance.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `chap_secret` - The Challenge-Handshake-Authentication-Protocol (CHAP) secret valid for the associated CHAP user name. (Also called the "CHAP password".)

	
* `chap_username` - The volume's system-generated Challenge-Handshake-Authentication-Protocol (CHAP) user name. See [RFC 1994](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1994) for more on CHAP.  Example: `ocid1.volume.oc1.phx.<unique_ID>` 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment.
* `device` - The device name.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it cannot be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My volume attachment` 
* `id` - The OCID of the volume attachment.
* `instance_id` - The OCID of the instance the volume is attached to.
* `ipv4` - The volume's iSCSI IP address.  Example: `169.254.0.2` 
* `iqn` - The target volume's iSCSI Qualified Name in the format defined by [RFC 3720](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3720#page-32).  Example: `iqn.2015-12.us.oracle.com:<CHAP_username>` 
* `is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled` - Whether in-transit encryption for the data volume's paravirtualized attachment is enabled or not.
* `is_read_only` - Whether the attachment was created in read-only mode.
* `port` - The volume's iSCSI port, usually port 860 or 3260.  Example: `3260` 
* `state` - The current state of the volume attachment.
* `time_created` - The date and time the volume was created, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `volume_id` - The OCID of the volume.

## Import

VolumeAttachments can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_core_volume_attachment.test_volume_attachment "id"
```
