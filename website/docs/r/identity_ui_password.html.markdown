# oci_identity_ui_password
This resource provides the Ui Password resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Creates a new Console one-time password for the specified user. For more information about user
credentials, see [User Credentials](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm).

Use this operation after creating a new user, or if a user forgets their password. The new one-time
password is returned to you in the response, and you must securely deliver it to the user. They'll
be prompted to change this password the next time they sign in to the Console. If they don't change
it within 7 days, the password will expire and you'll need to create a new one-time password for the
user.

**Note:** The user's Console login is the unique name you specified when you created the user
(see [CreateUser](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/User/CreateUser)).
