# oci_core_boot_volume_backup
This resource provides the Boot Volume Backup resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new boot volume backup of the specified boot volume. For general information about boot volume backups,
see [Overview of Boot Volume Backups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/bootvolumebackups.htm)

When the request is received, the backup object is in a REQUEST_RECEIVED state.
When the data is imaged, it goes into a CREATING state.
After the backup is fully uploaded to the cloud, it goes into an AVAILABLE state.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_boot_volume_backup" "test_boot_volume_backup" {
	#Required
	boot_volume_id = "${oci_core_boot_volume.test_boot_volume.id}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.boot_volume_backup_display_name}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	type = "${var.boot_volume_backup_type}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `boot_volume_id` - (Required) The OCID of the boot volume that needs to be backed up.
* `compartment_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment that contains the boot volume backup.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name for the boot volume backup. Does not have to be unique and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `type` - (Optional) The type of backup to create. If omitted, defaults to incremental.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `boot_volume_id` - The OCID of the boot volume.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the boot volume backup.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the boot volume backup. Does not have to be unique and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `expiration_time` - The date and time the volume backup will expire and be automatically deleted. Format defined by RFC3339. This parameter will always be present for backups that were created automatically by a scheduled-backup policy. For manually created backups, it will be absent, signifying that there is no expiration time and the backup will last forever until manually deleted. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the boot volume backup.
* `image_id` - The image OCID used to create the boot volume the backup is taken from.
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the KMS key which is the master encryption key for the boot volume backup. For more information about the Key Management service and encryption keys, see [Overview of Key Management](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm) and [Using Keys](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/usingkeys.htm). 
* `size_in_gbs` - The size of the boot volume, in GBs. 
* `source_type` - Specifies whether the backup was created manually, or via scheduled backup policy.
* `state` - The current state of a boot volume backup.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the boot volume backup was created. This is the time the actual point-in-time image of the volume data was taken. Format defined by RFC3339. 
* `time_request_received` - The date and time the request to create the boot volume backup was received. Format defined by RFC3339. 
* `type` - The type of a volume backup. Supported values are 'FULL' or 'INCREMENTAL'.
* `unique_size_in_gbs` - The size used by the backup, in GBs. It is typically smaller than `size_in_gbs`, depending on the space consumed on the boot volume and whether the backup is full or incremental. 

## Import

BootVolumeBackups can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_core_boot_volume_backup.test_boot_volume_backup "id"
```
