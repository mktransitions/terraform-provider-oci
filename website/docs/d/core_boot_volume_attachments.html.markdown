# Data Source: oci_core_boot_volume_attachments
This data source provides the list of Boot Volume Attachments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the boot volume attachments in the specified compartment. You can filter the
list by specifying an instance OCID, boot volume OCID, or both.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_boot_volume_attachments" "test_boot_volume_attachments" {
	#Required
	availability_domain = "${var.boot_volume_attachment_availability_domain}"
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	boot_volume_id = "${oci_core_boot_volume.test_boot_volume.id}"
	instance_id = "${oci_core_instance.test_instance.id}"
}
```
For more detailed implementation refer the [instance example](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/compute/instance)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Required) The name of the availability domain.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `boot_volume_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the boot volume.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `instance_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the instance.
