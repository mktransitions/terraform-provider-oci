This data source provides details about a specific Ip Sec Connection Tunnel resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Gets the specified IPSec connection's specified tunnel basic information.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_ipsec_connection_tunnel" "test_ip_sec_connection_tunnel" {
	#Required
	ipsec_id = oci_core_ipsec.test_ipsec.id
	tunnel_id = oci_core_tunnel.test_tunnel.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ipsec_id` - (Required) The OCID of the IPSec connection.
