# Data Source: oci_objectstorage_bucket_summaries
This data source provides the list of Buckets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.

Gets a list of all BucketSummary items in a compartment. A BucketSummary contains only summary fields for the bucket
and does not contain fields like the user-defined metadata.

To use this and other API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
[Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_objectstorage_bucket_summaries" "test_buckets" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	namespace = var.bucket_namespace
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list buckets.
* `namespace` - (Required) The Object Storage namespace used for the request.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `bucket_summaries` - The list of bucket_summaries.

### Bucket Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `access_type` - The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to `NoPublicAccess` by default, which only allows an authenticated caller to access the bucket and its contents. When `ObjectRead` is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, and `ListObjects` operations. When `ObjectReadWithoutList` is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the `GetObject` and `HeadObject` operations. 
* `approximate_count` - The approximate number of objects in the bucket. Count statistics are reported periodically. You will see a lag between what is displayed and the actual object count. 
* `approximate_size` - The approximate total size in bytes of all objects in the bucket. Size statistics are reported periodically. You will see a lag between what is displayed and the actual size of the bucket. 
* `compartment_id` - The compartment ID in which the bucket is authorized.
* `created_by` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the bucket.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `etag` - The entity tag (ETag) for the bucket.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_read_only` - Whether or not this bucket is read only. By default, `isReadOnly` is set to `false`. This will be set to 'true' when this bucket is configured as a destination in a replication policy. 
* `kms_key_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a master encryption key used to call the Key Management service to generate a data encryption key or to encrypt or decrypt a data encryption key. 
* `metadata` - Arbitrary string keys and values for user-defined metadata.
* `name` - The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: my-new-bucket1 
* `namespace` - The Object Storage namespace in which the bucket lives.
* `object_events_enabled` - Whether or not events are emitted for object state changes in this bucket. By default, `objectEventsEnabled` is set to `false`. Set `objectEventsEnabled` to `true` to emit events for object state changes. For more information about events, see [Overview of Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventsoverview.htm). 
* `object_lifecycle_policy_etag` - The entity tag (ETag) for the live object lifecycle policy on the bucket.
* `replication_enabled` - Whether or not this bucket is a replication source. By default, `replicationEnabled` is set to `false`. This will be set to 'true' when you create a replication policy for the bucket. 
* `storage_tier` - The storage tier type assigned to the bucket. A bucket is set to 'Standard' tier by default, which means objects uploaded or copied to the bucket will be in the standard storage tier. When the 'Archive' tier type is set explicitly for a bucket, objects uploaded or copied to the bucket will be stored in archive storage. The 'storageTier' property is immutable after bucket is created. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the bucket was created, as described in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29).
* `versioning` - The versioning status on the bucket. A bucket is created with versioning `Disabled` by default. For versioning `Enabled`, objects are protected from overwrites and deletes, by maintaining their version history. When versioning is `Suspended`, the previous versions will still remain but new versions will no longer be created when overwitten or deleted.
