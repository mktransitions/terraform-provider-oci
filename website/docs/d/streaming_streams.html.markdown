# Data Source: oci_streaming_streams
This data source provides the list of Streams in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service.

Lists the streams in the given compartment id.
If the compartment id is specified, it will list streams in the compartment, regardless of their stream pool.
If the stream pool id is specified, the action will be scoped to that stream pool.
The compartment id and stream pool id cannot be specified at the same time.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_streaming_streams" "test_streams" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	id = var.stream_id
	name = var.stream_name
	state = var.stream_state
	stream_pool_id = oci_streaming_stream_pool.test_stream_pool.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the compartment. Is exclusive with the `streamPoolId` parameter. One of them is required.
* `id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given ID exactly. 
* `name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given name exactly. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources that match the given lifecycle state. The state value is case-insensitive. 
* `stream_pool_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the stream pool. Is exclusive with the `compartmentId` parameter. One of them is required.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `streams` - The list of streams.

### Stream Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the stream.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}' 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair that is applied with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross-compatibility only. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the stream.
* `lifecycle_state_details` - Any additional details about the current state of the stream.
* `messages_endpoint` - The endpoint to use when creating the StreamClient to consume or publish messages in the stream. If the associated stream pool is private, the endpoint is also private and can only be accessed from inside the stream pool's associated subnet. 
* `name` - The name of the stream. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `TelemetryEvents` 
* `partitions` - The number of partitions in the stream.
* `retention_in_hours` - The retention period of the stream, in hours. This property is read-only.
* `state` - The current state of the stream.
* `stream_pool_id` - The OCID of the stream pool that contains the stream.
* `time_created` - The date and time the stream was created, expressed in in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339) timestamp format.  Example: `2018-04-20T00:00:07.405Z`
