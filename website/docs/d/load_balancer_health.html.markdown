## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `critical_state_backend_set_names` - A list of backend sets that are currently in the `CRITICAL` health state. The list identifies each backend set by the friendly name you assigned when you created it.  Example: `example_backend_set` 
* `status` - The overall health status of the load balancer.
	*  **OK:** All backend sets associated with the load balancer return a status of `OK`.
	*  **WARNING:** At least one of the backend sets associated with the load balancer returns a status of `WARNING`, no backend sets return a status of `CRITICAL`, and the load balancer life cycle state is `ACTIVE`.
	*  **CRITICAL:** One or more of the backend sets associated with the load balancer return a status of `CRITICAL`.
	*  **UNKNOWN:** If any one of the following conditions is true:
	*  The load balancer life cycle state is not `ACTIVE`.

	*  The system could not retrieve metrics for any reason. 
* `total_backend_set_count` - The total number of backend sets associated with this load balancer.  Example: `4` 
* `unknown_state_backend_set_names` - A list of backend sets that are currently in the `UNKNOWN` health state. The list identifies each backend set by the friendly name you assigned when you created it.  Example: `example_backend_set2` 
* `warning_state_backend_set_names` - A list of backend sets that are currently in the `WARNING` health state. The list identifies each backend set by the friendly name you assigned when you created it.  Example: `example_backend_set3`
