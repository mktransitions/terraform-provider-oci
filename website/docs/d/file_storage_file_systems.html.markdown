# Data Source: oci_file_storage_file_systems
This data source provides the list of File Systems in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service.

Lists the file system resources in the specified compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_file_storage_file_systems" "test_file_systems" {
	#Required
	availability_domain = "${var.file_system_availability_domain}"
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.file_system_display_name}"
	id = "${var.file_system_id}"
	state = "${var.file_system_state}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Required) The name of the availability domain.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable.  Example: `My resource` 
* `id` - (Optional) Filter results by OCID. Must be an OCID of the correct type for the resouce type. 
* `state` - (Optional) Filter results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type.

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the file system.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My file system`
