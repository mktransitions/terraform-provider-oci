This data source provides the list of Media Workflow Configurations in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Media Services service.

Returns a list of MediaWorkflowConfigurations.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_media_services_media_workflow_configurations" "test_media_workflow_configurations" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.media_workflow_configuration_display_name
	id = var.media_workflow_configuration_id
	state = var.media_workflow_configuration_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) Unique MediaWorkflowConfiguration identifier.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources with lifecycleState matching the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `media_workflow_configuration_collection` - The list of media_workflow_configuration_collection.

### MediaWorkflowConfiguration Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - Compartment Identifier.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - Display name for the MediaWorkflowConfiguration. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier that is immutable on creation.
* `lifecyle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in Failed state.
* `parameters` - Reuseable parameter values encoded as a JSON; the top and second level JSON elements are objects. Each key of the top level object refer to a task key that is unqiue to the workflow, each of the second level objects' keys refer to the name of a parameter that is unique to the task. taskKey -> parameterName -> parameterValue 
* `state` - The current state of the MediaWorkflowConfiguration.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The time when the the MediaWorkflowConfiguration was created. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
* `time_updated` - The time when the MediaWorkflowConfiguration was updated. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
