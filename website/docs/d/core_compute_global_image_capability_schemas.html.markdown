This data source provides the list of Compute Global Image Capability Schemas in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists Compute Global Image Capability Schema in the specified compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_compute_global_image_capability_schemas" "test_compute_global_image_capability_schemas" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.compute_global_image_capability_schema_display_name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given compartment OCID exactly. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compute_global_image_capability_schemas` - The list of compute_global_image_capability_schemas.

### ComputeGlobalImageCapabilitySchema Reference
