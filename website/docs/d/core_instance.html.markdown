# Data Source: oci_core_instance
This data source provides details about a specific Instance resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Gets information about the specified instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_instance" "test_instance" {
	#Required
	instance_id = oci_core_instance.test_instance.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance_id` - (Required) The OCID of the instance.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_config` - 
	* `is_management_disabled` - Whether the agent running on the instance can run all the available management plugins. 
	* `is_monitoring_disabled` - Whether the agent running on the instance can gather performance metrics and monitor the instance. 
* `availability_config` - 
	* `recovery_action` - Actions customers can specify that would be applied to their instances after scheduled or unexpected host maintenance.
		* `RESTORE_INSTANCE` - This would be the default action if recoveryAction is not set. VM instances will be restored to the power state it was in before maintenance.
		* `STOP_INSTANCE` - This action allow customers to have their VM instances be stopped after maintenance. 
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain the instance is running in.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `boot_volume_id` - The OCID of the attached boot volume. If the `source_type` is `bootVolume`, this will be the same OCID as the `source_id`.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the instance.
* `dedicated_vm_host_id` - The OCID of dedicated VM host. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My bare metal instance` 
* `extended_metadata` - Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the `metadata` object.

	They are distinguished from `metadata` fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas `metadata` fields are string/string maps only). 

	If you don't need nested metadata values, it is strongly advised to avoid using this object and use the Metadata object instead.

	Input in terraform is the same as metadata but allows nested metadata if you pass a valid JSON string as a value. See the example below.
* `fault_domain` - The name of the fault domain the instance is running in.

	A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

	If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you.

	Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `hostname_label` - The hostname for the instance VNIC's primary private IP. 
* `id` - The OCID of the instance.
* `image` - Deprecated. Use `sourceDetails` instead. 
* `ipxe_script` - When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

	If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

	The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.
