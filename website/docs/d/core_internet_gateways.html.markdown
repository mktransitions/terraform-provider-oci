# Data Source: oci_core_internet_gateways
This data source provides the list of Internet Gateways in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the internet gateways in the specified VCN and the specified compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_internet_gateways" "test_internet_gateways" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	vcn_id = "${oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.internet_gateway_display_name}"
	state = "${var.internet_gateway_state}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources that match the given lifecycle state.  The state value is case-insensitive. 
* `vcn_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VCN.
