# Data Source: oci_identity_policies
This data source provides the list of Policies in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Lists the policies in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or another of your compartments).
See [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five).

To determine which policies apply to a particular group or compartment, you must view the individual
statements inside all your policies. There isn't a way to automatically obtain that information via the API.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_identity_policies" "test_policies" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.tenancy_ocid
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `policies` - The list of policies.

### Policy Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the policy (either the tenancy or another compartment). 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description you assign to the policy. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the policy.
* `inactive_state` - The detailed status of INACTIVE lifecycleState.
* `name` - The name you assign to the policy during creation. The name must be unique across all policies in the tenancy and cannot be changed. 
* `state` - The policy's current state.
* `statements` - An array of one or more policy statements written in the policy language.
* `time_created` - Date and time the policy was created, in the format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `version_date` - The version of the policy. If null or set to an empty string, when a request comes in for authorization, the policy will be evaluated according to the current behavior of the services at that moment. If set to a particular date (YYYY-MM-DD), the policy will be evaluated according to the behavior of the services on that date.
