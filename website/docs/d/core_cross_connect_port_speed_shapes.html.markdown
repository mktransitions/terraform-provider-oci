so you can specify your desired port speed (that is, shape) when you create a
cross-connect.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_cross_connect_port_speed_shapes" "test_cross_connect_port_speed_shapes" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
