# Data Source: oci_monitoring_metrics
This data source provides the list of Metrics in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring service.

Returns metric definitions that match the criteria specified in the request. Compartment OCID required.
For information about metrics, see [Metrics Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#MetricsOverview).
For important limits information, see [Limits on Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#Limits).

Transactions Per Second (TPS) per-tenancy limit for this operation: 10.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_monitoring_metrics" "test_metrics" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.metric_compartment_id_in_subtree
	dimension_filters = var.metric_dimension_filters
	group_by = var.metric_group_by
	name = var.metric_name
	namespace = var.metric_namespace
	resource_group = var.metric_resource_group
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the metric that you are searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the root compartment.  Example: `ocid1.compartment.oc1..exampleuniqueID` 
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) When true, returns resources from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment specified in compartmentId. Default is false. 
* `dimension_filters` - (Optional) Qualifiers that you want to use when searching for metric definitions. Available dimensions vary by metric namespace. Each dimension takes the form of a key-value pair.  Example: { "resourceId": "<var>&lt;instance_OCID&gt;</var>" } 
* `group_by` - (Optional) Group metrics by these fields in the response. For example, to list all metric namespaces available in a compartment, groupBy the "namespace" field. Supported fields: namespace, name, resourceGroup.

	Example - group by namespace: `[ "namespace" ]` 
* `name` - (Optional) The metric name to use when searching for metric definitions.  Example: `CpuUtilization` 
* `namespace` - (Optional) The source service or application to use when searching for metric definitions.  Example: `oci_computeagent` 
* `resource_group` - (Optional) Resource group that you want to use as a filter. The specified resource group must exist in the definition of the posted metric. Only one resource group can be applied per metric. A valid resourceGroup value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and dollar signs ($). Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `frontend-fleet` 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `metrics` - The list of metrics.

### Metric Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the metric. 
* `dimensions` - Qualifiers provided in a metric definition. Available dimensions vary by metric namespace. Each dimension takes the form of a key-value pair.  Example: `"resourceId": "ocid1.instance.region1.phx.exampleuniqueID"` 
* `name` - The name of the metric.  Example: `CpuUtilization` 
* `namespace` - The source service or application emitting the metric.  Example: `oci_computeagent` 
* `resource_group` - Resource group provided with the posted metric. A resource group is a custom string that can be used as a filter. Only one resource group can be applied per metric. A valid resourceGroup value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and dollar signs ($). Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `frontend-fleet`
