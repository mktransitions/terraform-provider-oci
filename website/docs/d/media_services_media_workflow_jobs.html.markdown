data "oci_media_services_media_workflow_jobs" "test_media_workflow_jobs" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.media_workflow_job_display_name
	id = var.media_workflow_job_id
	media_workflow_id = oci_media_services_media_workflow.test_media_workflow.id
	state = var.media_workflow_job_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) unique MediaWorkflowJob identifier
* `media_workflow_id` - (Applicable when workflow_identifier_type=ID) Unique MediaWorkflow identifier.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources with lifecycleState matching the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `media_workflow_job_collection` - The list of media_workflow_job_collection.

* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - Name of the Media Workflow Job. Does not have to be unique. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier for this run of the workflow.
* `lifecycle_details` - The lifecyle details.
* `media_workflow_configuration_ids` - Configurations to be applied to this run of the workflow.
* `media_workflow_id` - The workflow to execute.
* `outputs` - A list of JobOutput for the workflowJob.
	* `asset_type` - Type of job output.
	* `bucket` - The bucket name of the job output.
	* `id` - The ID associated with the job output.
	* `namespace` - The namespace name of the job output.
	* `object` - The object name of the job output.
* `parameters` - Parameters that override parameters specified in MediaWorkflowTaskDeclarations, the MediaWorkflow, the MediaWorkflow's MediaWorkflowConfigurations and the MediaWorkflowConfigurations of this MediaWorkflowJob. The parameters are given as JSON.  The top level and 2nd level elements must be JSON objects (vs arrays, scalars, etc). The top level keys refer to a task's key and the 2nd level keys refer to a parameter's name. 
* `runnable` - A JSON representation of the job as it will be run by the system. All the task declarations, configurations and parameters are merged. Parameter values are all fully resolved. 
* `state` - The current state of the MediaWorkflowJob.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `task_lifecycle_state` - Status of each task.
	* `key` - Unique key within a MediaWorkflowJob for the task.
	* `lifecycle_details` - The lifecycle details of MediaWorkflowJob task.
	* `state` - The current state of the MediaWorkflowJob task.
* `time_created` - Creation time of the job. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
* `time_ended` - Time when the job finished. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
* `time_started` - Time when the job started to execute. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
