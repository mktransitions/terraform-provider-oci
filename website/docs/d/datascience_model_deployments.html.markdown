# Data Source: oci_datascience_model_deployments
This data source provides the list of Model Deployments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Datascience service.

Lists all model deployments in the specified compartment. Only one parameter other than compartmentId may also be included in a query. The query must include compartmentId. If the query does not include compartmentId, or includes compartmentId but two or more other parameters an error is returned.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_datascience_model_deployments" "test_model_deployments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	created_by = var.model_deployment_created_by
	display_name = var.model_deployment_display_name
	id = var.model_deployment_id
	project_id = oci_datascience_project.test_project.id
	state = var.model_deployment_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `created_by` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the resource.
* `display_name` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by its user-friendly name.
* `id` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). Must be an OCID of the correct type for the resource type.
* `project_id` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the project.
* `state` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type.
