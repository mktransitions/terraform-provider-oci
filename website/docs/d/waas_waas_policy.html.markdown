	waas_policy_id = "${oci_waas_waas_policy.test_waas_policy.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `waas_policy_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the WAAS policy.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `additional_domains` - An array of additional domains for this web application.
* `cname` - The CNAME record to add to your DNS configuration to route traffic for the domain, and all additional domains, through the WAF.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the WAAS policy's compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name of the WAAS policy. The name can be changed and does not need to be unique.
* `domain` - The web application domain that the WAAS policy protects.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the WAAS policy.
* `origin_groups` - The map of origin groups and their keys used to associate origins to the `wafConfig`. Origin groups allow you to apply weights to groups of origins for load balancing purposes. Origins with higher weights will receive larger proportions of client requests.
	* `origins` - The list of objects containing origin references and additional properties.
* `origins` - A map of host servers (origins) and their keys for the web application. Origin keys are used to associate origins to specific protection rules. The key should be a user-friendly name for the host. **Examples:** `primary` or `secondary`.
	* `custom_headers` - A list of HTTP headers to forward to your origin.
		* `name` - The name of the header.
		* `value` - The value of the header.
	* `http_port` - The HTTP port on the origin that the web application listens on. If unspecified, defaults to `80`.
	* `https_port` - The HTTPS port on the origin that the web application listens on. If unspecified, defaults to `443`.
	* `uri` - The URI of the origin. Does not support paths. Port numbers should be specified in the `httpPort` and `httpsPort` fields.
* `policy_config` - 
	* `certificate_id` - The OCID of the SSL certificate to use if HTTPS is supported.
	* `cipher_group` - The set cipher group for the configured TLS protocol. This sets the configuration for the TLS connections between clients and edge nodes only.
		* **DEFAULT:** Cipher group supports TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 protocols. It has the following ciphers enabled: `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES:CAMELLIA:!DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA`
	* `client_address_header` - Specifies an HTTP header name which is treated as the connecting client's IP address. Applicable only if `isBehindCdn` is enabled.

		The edge node reads this header and its value and sets the client IP address as specified. It does not create the header if the header is not present in the request. If the header is not present, the connecting IP address will be used as the client's true IP address. It uses the last IP address in the header's value as the true IP address.

		Example: `X-Client-Ip: 11.1.1.1, 13.3.3.3`

		In the case of multiple headers with the same name, only the first header will be used. It is assumed that CDN sets the correct client IP address to prevent spoofing.
		* **X_FORWARDED_FOR:** Corresponds to `X-Forwarded-For` header name.
		* **X_CLIENT_IP:** Corresponds to `X-Client-Ip` header name.
		* **X_REAL_IP:** Corresponds to `X-Real-Ip` header name.
		* **CLIENT_IP:** Corresponds to `Client-Ip` header name.
		* **TRUE_CLIENT_IP:** Corresponds to `True-Client-Ip` header name.
	* `is_behind_cdn` - Enabling `isBehindCdn` allows for the collection of IP addresses from client requests if the WAF is connected to a CDN.
	* `is_cache_control_respected` - Enable or disable automatic content caching based on the response `cache-control` header. This feature enables the origin to act as a proxy cache. Caching is usually defined using `cache-control` header. For example `cache-control: max-age=120` means that the returned resource is valid for 120 seconds. Caching rules will overwrite this setting.
	* `is_https_enabled` - Enable or disable HTTPS support. If true, a `certificateId` is required. If unspecified, defaults to `false`.
	* `is_https_forced` - Force HTTP to HTTPS redirection. If unspecified, defaults to `false`.
	* `is_origin_compression_enabled` - Enable or disable GZIP compression of origin responses. If enabled, the header `Accept-Encoding: gzip` is sent to origin, otherwise, the empty `Accept-Encoding:` header is used.
	* `is_response_buffering_enabled` - Enable or disable buffering of responses from the origin. Buffering improves overall stability in case of network issues, but slightly increases Time To First Byte.
	* `tls_protocols` - A list of allowed TLS protocols. Only applicable when HTTPS support is enabled. The TLS protocol is negotiated while the request is connecting and the most recent protocol supported by both the edge node and client browser will be selected. If no such version exists, the connection will be aborted.
		* **TLS_V1:** corresponds to TLS 1.0 specification.
		* **TLS_V1_1:** corresponds to TLS 1.1 specification.
		* **TLS_V1_2:** corresponds to TLS 1.2 specification.
		* **TLS_V1_3:** corresponds to TLS 1.3 specification.

		Enabled TLS protocols must go in a row. For example if `TLS_v1_1` and `TLS_V1_3` are enabled, `TLS_V1_2` must be enabled too.
