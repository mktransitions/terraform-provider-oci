# Data Source: oci_objectstorage_bucket
This data source provides details about a specific Bucket resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.

Gets the current representation of the given bucket in the given Object Storage namespace.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_objectstorage_bucket" "test_bucket" {
	#Required
	name = var.bucket_name
	namespace = var.bucket_namespace
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: `my-new-bucket1` 
* `namespace` - (Required) The Object Storage namespace used for the request.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `access_type` - The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to `NoPublicAccess` by default, which only allows an authenticated caller to access the bucket and its contents. When `ObjectRead` is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, and `ListObjects` operations. When `ObjectReadWithoutList` is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the `GetObject` and `HeadObject` operations. 
* `approximate_count` - The approximate number of objects in the bucket. Count statistics are reported periodically. You will see a lag between what is displayed and the actual object count. 
* `approximate_size` - The approximate total size in bytes of all objects in the bucket. Size statistics are reported periodically. You will see a lag between what is displayed and the actual size of the bucket. 
* `bucket_id` - The OCID of the bucket which is a Oracle assigned unique identifier for this resource type (bucket). `bucket_id` cannot be used for bucket lookup.
* `compartment_id` - The compartment ID in which the bucket is authorized.
* `created_by` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the bucket.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `etag` - The entity tag (ETag) for the bucket.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_read_only` - Whether or not this bucket is read only. By default, `isReadOnly` is set to `false`. This will be set to 'true' when this bucket is configured as a destination in a replication policy. 
* `kms_key_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a master encryption key used to call the Key Management service to generate a data encryption key or to encrypt or decrypt a data encryption key. 
* `metadata` - Arbitrary string keys and values for user-defined metadata.
* `name` - The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: my-new-bucket1 
* `namespace` - The Object Storage namespace in which the bucket lives.
* `object_events_enabled` - Whether or not events are emitted for object state changes in this bucket. By default, `objectEventsEnabled` is set to `false`. Set `objectEventsEnabled` to `true` to emit events for object state changes. For more information about events, see [Overview of Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/eventsoverview.htm). 
* `object_lifecycle_policy_etag` - The entity tag (ETag) for the live object lifecycle policy on the bucket.
* `retention_rules` - User specified list of retention rules for the bucket.
    * `display_name` - User specified name for the retention rule.
    * `duration` - 
        * `time_amount` - The timeAmount is interpreted in units defined by the timeUnit parameter, and is calculated in relation to each object's Last-Modified timestamp. 
        * `time_unit` - The unit that should be used to interpret timeAmount.
    * `retention_rule_id` - Unique identifier for the retention rule.
    * `time_created` - The date and time that the retention rule was created as per [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
    * `time_modified` - The date and time that the retention rule was modified as per [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
    * `time_rule_locked` - The date and time as per [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) after which this rule becomes locked. and can only be deleted by deleting the bucket. 
* `replication_enabled` - Whether or not this bucket is a replication source. By default, `replicationEnabled` is set to `false`. This will be set to 'true' when you create a replication policy for the bucket. 
* `storage_tier` - The storage tier type assigned to the bucket. A bucket is set to 'Standard' tier by default, which means objects uploaded or copied to the bucket will be in the standard storage tier. When the 'Archive' tier type is set explicitly for a bucket, objects uploaded or copied to the bucket will be stored in archive storage. The 'storageTier' property is immutable after bucket is created. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the bucket was created, as described in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29).
* `versioning` - The versioning status on the bucket. A bucket is created with versioning `Disabled` by default. For versioning `Enabled`, objects are protected from overwrites and deletes, by maintaining their version history. When versioning is `Suspended`, the previous versions will still remain but new versions will no longer be created when overwitten or deleted.
