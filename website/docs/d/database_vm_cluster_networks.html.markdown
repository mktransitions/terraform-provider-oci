# Data Source: oci_database_vm_cluster_networks
This data source provides the list of Vm Cluster Networks in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets a list of the VM cluster networks in the specified compartment.            


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_vm_cluster_networks" "test_vm_cluster_networks" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	exadata_infrastructure_id = "${oci_database_exadata_infrastructure.test_exadata_infrastructure.id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.vm_cluster_network_display_name}"
	state = "${var.vm_cluster_network_state}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - (Required) The Exadata infrastructure [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.
