# Data Source: oci_core_nat_gateways
This data source provides the list of Nat Gateways in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the NAT gateways in the specified compartment. You may optionally specify a VCN OCID
to filter the results by VCN.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_nat_gateways" "test_nat_gateways" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"

	#Optional
	display_name = "${var.nat_gateway_display_name}"
	state = "${var.nat_gateway_state}"
	vcn_id = "${oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified lifecycle state. The value is case insensitive. 
* `vcn_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VCN.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `nat_gateways` - The list of nat_gateways.

### NatGateway Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `block_traffic` - Whether the NAT gateway blocks traffic through it. The default is `false`.  Example: `true` 
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment that contains the NAT gateway. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}`
