# Data Source: oci_opsi_host_insights
This data source provides the list of Host Insights in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Opsi service.

Gets a list of host insights based on the query parameters specified. Either compartmentId or id query parameter must be specified.
When both compartmentId and compartmentIdInSubtree are specified, a list of host insights in that compartment and in all sub-compartments will be returned.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_opsi_host_insights" "test_host_insights" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.host_insight_compartment_id_in_subtree
	enterprise_manager_bridge_id = oci_opsi_enterprise_manager_bridge.test_enterprise_manager_bridge.id
	exadata_insight_id = oci_opsi_exadata_insight.test_exadata_insight.id
	host_type = var.host_insight_host_type
	id = var.host_insight_id
	state = var.host_insight_state
	status = var.host_insight_status
}
```
