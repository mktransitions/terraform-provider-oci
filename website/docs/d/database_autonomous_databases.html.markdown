* `service_console_url` - The URL of the Service Console for the Autonomous Database.
* `source_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the source Autonomous Database that was cloned to create the current Autonomous Database.
* `standby_db` - 
	* `lag_time_in_seconds` - The amount of time, in seconds, that the data of the standby database lags the data of the primary database. Can be used to determine the potential data loss in the event of a failover.
	* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
	* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Database.
* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Database.
* `subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the resource is associated with.

	**Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
	* For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.

	These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. 
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `time_created` - The date and time the Autonomous Database was created.
* `time_deletion_of_free_autonomous_database` - The date and time the Always Free database will be automatically deleted because of inactivity. If the database is in the STOPPED state and without activity until this time, it will be deleted. 
* `time_maintenance_begin` - The date and time when maintenance will begin.
* `time_maintenance_end` - The date and time when maintenance will end.
* `time_of_last_failover` - The timestamp of the last failover operation.
* `time_of_last_refresh` - The date and time when last refresh happened.
* `time_of_last_refresh_point` - The refresh point timestamp (UTC). The refresh point is the time to which the database was most recently refreshed. Data created after the refresh point is not included in the refresh.
* `time_of_last_switchover` - The timestamp of the last switchover operation for the Autonomous Database.
* `time_of_next_refresh` - The date and time of next refresh.
* `time_reclamation_of_free_autonomous_database` - The date and time the Always Free database will be stopped because of inactivity. If this time is reached without any database activity, the database will automatically be put into the STOPPED state. 
* `used_data_storage_size_in_tbs` - The amount of storage that has been used, in terabytes.
* `whitelisted_ips` - The client IP access control list (ACL). This feature is available for databases on [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI) only. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. This is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID.

	To add the whitelist VCN specific subnet or IP, use a semicoln ';' as a deliminator to add the VCN specific subnets or IPs. For update operation, if you wish to delete all the existing whitelisted IP’s, use an array with a single empty string entry. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.0.0/16"]`
