# Data Source: oci_core_compute_global_image_capability_schemas_version
This data source provides details about a specific Compute Global Image Capability Schemas Version resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Gets the specified Compute Global Image Capability Schema Version

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_compute_global_image_capability_schemas_version" "test_compute_global_image_capability_schemas_version" {
	#Required
	compute_global_image_capability_schema_id = oci_core_compute_global_image_capability_schema.test_compute_global_image_capability_schema.id
	compute_global_image_capability_schema_version_name = var.compute_global_image_capability_schemas_version_compute_global_image_capability_schema_version_name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compute_global_image_capability_schema_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compute global image capability schema
