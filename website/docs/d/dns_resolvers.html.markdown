# Data Source: oci_dns_resolvers
This data source provides the list of Resolvers in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS service.

Gets a list of all resolvers within a compartment.

The collection can be filtered by display name, id, or lifecycle state. It can be sorted
on creation time or displayName both in ASC or DESC order. Note that when no lifecycleState
query parameter is provided, the collection does not include resolvers in the DELETED
lifecycleState to be consistent with other operations of the API.

	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	scope = "PRIVATE"

	#Optional
	display_name = var.resolver_display_name
	id = var.resolver_id
	state = var.resolver_state
