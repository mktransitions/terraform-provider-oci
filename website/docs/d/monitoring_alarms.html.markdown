# Data Source: oci_monitoring_alarms
This data source provides the list of Alarms in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring service.

Lists the alarms for the specified compartment.
For important limits information, see [Limits on Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#Limits).

This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total number of requests across all alarm operations. 
Monitoring might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests, 
or transactions, per second (TPS) for a given tenancy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_monitoring_alarms" "test_alarms" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.alarm_compartment_id_in_subtree
	display_name = var.alarm_display_name
	state = var.alarm_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the metric that you are searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the root compartment.  Example: `ocid1.compartment.oc1..exampleuniqueID` 
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) When true, returns resources from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment specified in compartmentId. Default is false. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. Use this filter to list an alarm by name. Alternatively, when you know the alarm OCID, use the GetAlarm operation. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only alarms that match the given lifecycle state exactly. When not specified, only alarms in the ACTIVE lifecycle state are listed. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `alarms` - The list of alarms.

### Alarm Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `body` - The human-readable content of the notification delivered. Oracle recommends providing guidance to operators for resolving the alarm condition. Consider adding links to standard runbook practices. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `High CPU usage alert. Follow runbook instructions for resolution.` 
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the alarm. 
* `defined_tags` - Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `destinations` - A list of destinations to which the notifications for this alarm will be delivered.  Each destination is represented by an [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) related to the supported destination service. For example, a destination using the Notifications service is represented by a topic OCID.  Supported destination services: Notifications Service. Limit: One destination per supported destination service. 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the alarm. It does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

	This name is sent as the title for notifications related to this alarm.

	Example: `High CPU Utilization` 
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the alarm. 
* `is_enabled` - Whether the alarm is enabled.  Example: `true` 
* `metric_compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the metric being evaluated by the alarm. 
* `metric_compartment_id_in_subtree` - When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, the alarm evaluates metrics from only the compartment specified in metricCompartmentId. Default is false.  Example: `true` 
* `namespace` - The source service or application emitting the metric that is evaluated by the alarm.  Example: `oci_computeagent` 
* `pending_duration` - The period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must persist before the alarm state  changes from "OK" to "FIRING". For example, a value of 5 minutes means that the  alarm must persist in breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its  state to "FIRING". 

	The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (`PT10M` for ten minutes or `PT1H` for one hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H. Default: PT1M.

	Under the default value of PT1M, the first evaluation that breaches the alarm updates the state to "FIRING". 

	The alarm updates its status to "OK" when the breaching condition has been clear for  the most recent minute. 

	Example: `PT5M` 
* `query` - The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of  the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values,  where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger  rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger  rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: `1m`-`60m` (also `1h`). You can optionally  specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`, `groupBy()`.  For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm).  For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service.  See [Supported Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices).

	Example of threshold alarm:

	-----

	CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-AD-1"}.groupBy(availabilityDomain).percentile(0.9) > 85

	-----

	Example of absence alarm:

	-----

	CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-AD-1"}.absent()

	----- 
* `repeat_notification_duration` - The frequency at which notifications are re-submitted, if the alarm keeps firing without interruption. Format defined by ISO 8601. For example, `PT4H` indicates four hours. Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: P30D.

	Default value: null (notifications are not re-submitted).

	Example: `PT2H` 
* `resolution` - The time between calculated aggregation windows for the alarm. Supported value: `1m` 
* `resource_group` - Resource group specified as a filter for metric data retrieved by the alarm. A resource group is a custom string that can be used as a filter. Only one resource group can be applied per metric. A valid resourceGroup value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and dollar signs ($). Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `frontend-fleet` 
* `severity` - The perceived type of response required when the alarm is in the "FIRING" state.  Example: `CRITICAL` 
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the alarm.  Example: `DELETED` 
* `suppression` - The configuration details for suppressing an alarm. 
	* `description` - Human-readable reason for suppressing alarm notifications. It does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

		Oracle recommends including tracking information for the event or associated work, such as a ticket number.

		Example: `Planned outage due to change IT-1234.` 
	* `time_suppress_from` - The start date and time for the suppression to take place, inclusive. Format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2019-02-01T01:02:29.600Z` 
	* `time_suppress_until` - The end date and time for the suppression to take place, inclusive. Format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2019-02-01T02:02:29.600Z` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the alarm was created. Format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2019-02-01T01:02:29.600Z` 
* `time_updated` - The date and time the alarm was last updated. Format defined by RFC3339.  Example: `2019-02-03T01:02:29.600Z`
