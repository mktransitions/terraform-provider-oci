# Data Source: oci_marketplace_listings
This data source provides the list of Listings in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace service.

Gets a list of listings from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace by searching keywords and
filtering according to listing attributes.

If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.

Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
[CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.

To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.
