### Data Sources Filtering

Most data sources that return lists of resources now support filtering 
semantics. To employ a filter include this block in your data source 
definition:

```
filter {
	name = ""
	values = [""]
}
```

The `name` value corresponds to the property name to filter with 
and the `values` lists can contain one or more values filter with. 

Multiple `values` work as an **OR** type filter. In the shape 
example below, the resulting data source would contain both VM 
shapes _Standard 1.1_ and _Standard 1.2_:
```
data "oci_core_shape" "t" {
  ...
  filter {
    name = "name"
    values = ["VM.Standard1.1", "VM.Standard1.2"]
  }
}
```

Multiple filters blocks can be composed to form **AND** type comparisons 
as well. The example below will return a data source containing 
_running instances_ in the _first AD_ of a region:
```
data "oci_core_instances" "s" {
	...
  filter {
    name = "availability_domain"
    values = ["\\w*-AD-1"]
    regex = true
  }

  filter {
    name = "state"
    values = ["RUNNING"]
  }
}
        
```

As shown above, filters can also employ regular expressions. By setting
`regex = true`, each item in the `values` list will be treated as a 
regular expression. Note that backslashes in strings for regular
expression special characters need to be escaped with another slash,
shown above as the first `\` before `\w` in `"\\w*-AD-1"`.

### Limitations
Currently filters can only target top level string attributes of a 
resource (or top level arrays of strings). 

Support for other types (booleans) and drilling into properties of 
structured objects or lists of structured objects is not currently 
supported. If these properties are targeted no results will be 
returned from the datasource.
