## Creating buckets
This example creates a single bucket inside a compartment

### Using this example
* Update env-vars with the required information. Most examples use the same set of environment variables so you only need to do this once.
* Source env-vars
  * `$ . env-vars`
* Update `variables.tf` with your instance options.

### Files in the configuration

#### `env-vars`
Is used to export the environmental variables used in the configuration. These are usually authentication related, be sure to exclude this file from your version control system. It's typical to keep this file outside of the configuration.

Before you plan, apply, or destroy the configuration source the file -  
`$ . env-vars`

#### `variables.tf`
Defines the variables used in the configuration

#### `object.tf`
Defines the buckets we are going to create

#### `provider.tf`
Specifies and passes authentication details to the OCI TF provider
