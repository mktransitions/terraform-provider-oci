This example creates a VCN with a management subnet. It then launches an instance in the management subnet and configures it to perform DNS forwarding for DNS hostnames in the VCN, and the DNS hostnames in the on-premises network. See document for more details on the setup. 

### Using this example
* Update env-vars with the required information. Most examples use the same set of environment variables so you only need to do this once.
* Source env-vars
  * `$ . env-vars`

### Files in the configuration

#### `env-vars`
Is used to export the environmental variables used in the configuration. These are usually authentication related, be sure to exclude this file from your version control system. It's typical to keep this file outside of the configuration.

Before you plan, apply, or destroy the configuration source the file -  
`$ . env-vars`

#### `dns.tf`
Defines the resources.
