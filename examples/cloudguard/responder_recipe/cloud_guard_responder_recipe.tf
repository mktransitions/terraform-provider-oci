  /*
  When CloudGuard is Enabled, an Oracle Managed Responder Recipe is made available having all the default rules in their default state.
  If an user needs to make its own recipe with customizations to the rules, it needs to clone an `ORACLE MANAGED RESPONDER RECIPE`.
  In order to clone an `ORACLE MANAGED RESPONDER RECIPE` (Create new Responder Recipe) the source responder recipe id needs to be the ocid of
  `ORACLE MANAGED RESPONDER RECIPE`.
  In order to achieve that, we will list all the responder recipes and then pick the first item (Oracle Managed Recipe) in the collection for cloning.

  However if user wants to create and manage the ORACLE MANAGED Entity itself, it will have to enable the cloudguard with
  selfManageResources flag set to true. (More details in cloud_guard_configuration.tf)
  If user chooses to create its own ORACLE Managed Entity, below value should have id of the ORACLE
  MANAGED Entity which is always available
