_This build contains a known issue where updates to a Route Table's Route Rules (when they contain a rule that includes a Service Gateway ID) fail with a 400 service error code (#558). The issue is fixed in v2.1.15._

### Added

The internal representation has been changed from Lists to Sets, which results in unexpected but innocuous Terraform behavior. See this issue for discussion: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15180
- Default timeout changed from 5 minutes to 15 minutes to accommodate some resources that may take longer to succeed
- Ability to update compartment of an Object Storage Bucket

- Support db_system_id for db_versions data source.
- The db_system_shapes data source results now include information about max/min node count, and min core count supported by the relevant shape.
- Assign backup policies to volumes.
- Support additional ways of finding a Public IP via custom Public IP data source.

### Changed
- Object Storage Object's attributes other than `name` are now marked `forceNew`. This is consistent with the behavior of the service as defined [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/objectstorage/20160918/Object/PutObject).

### Fixed
- Multiple updates on Object Storage Object's metadata used to cause contents of the file to get overwritten by its md5 value.
- DBSystems cpu_core_count was made optional as the service ignores it when you provide a VM shape. [#517](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/issues/517), [#539](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/issues/539).

## 2.1.1 - 2018-03-14

### Fixed
- VolumeAttachment: Handle unsupported attachment types. If an unsupported attachment type is returned by the service, the SDK's base interface is used to populate common fields.
- Instances: Add missing state field to datasource.

## 2.1.0 - 2018-03-08
More details for the changes introduced in 2.1.0 can be found [here](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/wiki/Details-for-v2.1.0-Release)

### Added
- [Client side filtering](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/blob/master/docs/Filters.md) is now enabled for all data sources that return a list.
- Some Core data sources now support server side filtering by `display_name` and `state`.
- New optional parameters and fields have been added to existing resources and data sources to support new functionality added by the services.
- Documentation files have been updated and improved. Documentation files for resources and data sources of the same entity have now been consolidated into one file.

### Deprecated
- `limit` and `page` parameters in data sources have been deprecated. All list data sources loop through all the pages and return one aggregated list.  
- The `time_modified` field was deprecated from a few resources as it is no longer set by the service.

### Fixed
- Updates to fields in `oci_objectstorage_preauthrequest` resource will force the destruction and recreation of the resource. Updates to fields in this resource had no effect earlier.
- Updating some fields resulted in nothing happening. This has been fixed.
- Unexpected destruction and recreation of `oci_objectstorage_object` was fixed by constraining all keys in the `metadata` map to be lower case.

### Notes
- With this release we started using the new official [OCI Go SDK](https://github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk). Widespread changes to the source code were needed to make this happen.
- Removing optional parameters from a created resource will not result in a difference and the value for that field will remain as it was. If you want to reset the field to the default value returned by the service for that field you will have to taint the resource to destroy it and recreate it.
- If upgrading the OCI provider from v1.x.x, see [this wiki](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/wiki/Oracle-Terraform-Provider-Name-Change) for migration steps.
- See docs for this version [here](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/v2.1.0).
